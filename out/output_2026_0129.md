## 0. [Everything in Its Place: Benchmarking Spatial Intelligence of Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20354) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20354
**Authors:** Zengbin Wang, Xuecai Hu, Yong Wang, Feng Xiong, Man Zhang, Xiangxiang Chu

**Abstract:**  Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-fidelity images, but they often fail in handling complex spatial relationships, e.g., spatial perception, reasoning, or interaction. These critical aspects are largely overlooked by current benchmarks due to their short or information-sparse prompt design. In this paper, we introduce SpatialGenEval, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial intelligence of T2I models, covering two key aspects: (1) SpatialGenEval involves 1,230 long, information-dense prompts across 25 real-world scenes. Each prompt integrates 10 spatial sub-domains and corresponding 10 multi-choice question-answer pairs, ranging from object position and layout to occlusion and causality. Our extensive evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art models reveals that higher-order spatial reasoning remains a primary bottleneck. (2) To demonstrate that the utility of our information-dense design goes beyond simple evaluation, we also construct the SpatialT2I dataset. It contains 15,400 text-image pairs with rewritten prompts to ensure image consistency while preserving information density. Fine-tuned results on current foundation models (i.e., Stable Diffusion-XL, Uniworld-V1, OmniGen2) yield consistent performance gains (+4.2%, +5.7%, +4.4%) and more realistic effects in spatial relations, highlighting a data-centric paradigm to achieve spatial intelligence in T2I models.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (new benchmark for spatial intelligence in T2I models) and criterion 3 (novel benchmark for spatial reasoning in generative models, with a data-centric approach). Also relevant to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and their spatial understanding).

## 1. [Hallucination Begins Where Saliency Drops](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20279) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20279
**Authors:** Xiaofeng Zhang, Yuanchao Zhu, Chaochen Gu, Xiaosong Yuan, Qiyan Zhao, Jiawei Cao, Feilong Tang, Sinan Fan, Yaomin Shen, Chen Shen, Hao Tang

**Abstract:**  Recent studies have examined attention dynamics in large vision-language models (LVLMs) to detect hallucinations. However, existing approaches remain limited in reliably distinguishing hallucinated from factually grounded outputs, as they rely solely on forward-pass attention patterns and neglect gradient-based signals that reveal how token influence propagates through the network. To bridge this gap, we introduce LVLMs-Saliency, a gradient-aware diagnostic framework that quantifies the visual grounding strength of each output token by fusing attention weights with their input gradients. Our analysis uncovers a decisive pattern: hallucinations frequently arise when preceding output tokens exhibit low saliency toward the prediction of the next token, signaling a breakdown in contextual memory retention. Leveraging this insight, we propose a dual-mechanism inference-time framework to mitigate hallucinations: (1) Saliency-Guided Rejection Sampling (SGRS), which dynamically filters candidate tokens during autoregressive decoding by rejecting those whose saliency falls below a context-adaptive threshold, thereby preventing coherence-breaking tokens from entering the output sequence; and (2) Local Coherence Reinforcement (LocoRE), a lightweight, plug-and-play module that strengthens attention from the current token to its most recent predecessors, actively counteracting the contextual forgetting behavior identified by LVLMs-Saliency. Extensive experiments across multiple LVLMs demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination rates while preserving fluency and task performance, offering a robust and interpretable solution for enhancing model reliability. Code is available at: https://github.com/zhangbaijin/LVLMs-Saliency

**Comment:** Directly matches criterion 2: Proposes a new, interpretable, gradient-aware framework for diagnosing and mitigating hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs), with empirical insights and a novel inference-time mechanism.

We provide public access to the code and model in an effort to narrow the divide between open-source and closed-source technologies. We believe our release will empower the community with practical applications across areas like content creation, gaming, and robot learning.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 and 4: introduces LingBot-World, an open-source world simulator for video generation, supporting real-time interactivity and long-term memory, with applications in robot learning and content creation.

## 3. [MemCtrl: Using MLLMs as Active Memory Controllers on Embodied Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20831) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20831
**Authors:** Vishnu Sashank Dorbala, Dinesh Manocha

**Abstract:**  Foundation models rely on in-context learning for personalized decision making. The limited size of this context window necessitates memory compression and retrieval systems like RAG. These systems however often treat memory as large offline storage spaces, which is unfavorable for embodied agents that are expected to operate under strict memory and compute constraints, online. In this work, we propose MemCtrl, a novel framework that uses Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for pruning memory online. MemCtrl augments MLLMs with a trainable memory head \mu that acts as a gate to determine which observations or reflections to retain, update, or discard during exploration. We evaluate with training two types of \mu, 1) via an offline expert, and 2) via online RL, and observe significant improvement in overall embodied task completion ability on \mu-augmented MLLMs. In particular, on augmenting two low performing MLLMs with MemCtrl on multiple subsets of the EmbodiedBench benchmark, we observe that \mu-augmented MLLMs show an improvement of around 16% on average, with over 20% on specific instruction subsets. Finally, we present a qualitative analysis on the memory fragments collected by \mu, noting the superior performance of \mu augmented MLLMs on long and complex instruction types.

**Comment:** This paper proposes MemCtrl, a framework using MLLMs as active memory controllers for embodied agents, with experiments on EmbodiedBench. This directly matches criterion 1 (spatial intelligence on embodied agents), criterion 2 (MLLMs), and criterion 3 (embodied AI methods with novel memory control).

## 4. [Sparse CLIP: Co-Optimizing Interpretability and Performance in Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20075) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20075
**Authors:** Chuan Qin, Constantin Venhoff, Sonia Joseph, Fanyi Xiao, Stefan Scherer

**Abstract:**  Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has become a cornerstone in vision-language representation learning, powering diverse downstream tasks and serving as the default vision backbone in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Despite its success, CLIP's dense and opaque latent representations pose significant interpretability challenges. A common assumption is that interpretability and performance are in tension: enforcing sparsity during training degrades accuracy, motivating recent post-hoc approaches such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). However, these post-hoc approaches often suffer from degraded downstream performance and loss of CLIP's inherent multimodal capabilities, with most learned features remaining unimodal.   We propose a simple yet effective approach that integrates sparsity directly into CLIP training, yielding representations that are both interpretable and performant. Compared to SAEs, our Sparse CLIP representations preserve strong downstream task performance, achieve superior interpretability, and retain multimodal capabilities. We show that multimodal sparse features enable straightforward semantic concept alignment and reveal training dynamics of how cross-modal knowledge emerges. Finally, as a proof of concept, we train a vision-language model on sparse CLIP representations that enables interpretable, vision-based steering capabilities. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom that interpretability requires sacrificing accuracy and demonstrate that interpretability and performance can be co-optimized, offering a promising design principle for future models.

**Comment:** Directly matches criterion 2 (VLLMs/MLLMs): Proposes a new method (Sparse CLIP) for co-optimizing interpretability and performance in CLIP, a foundational vision-language model, and demonstrates empirical insights into multimodal representations.

## 5. [OS-Marathon: Benchmarking Computer-Use Agents on Long-Horizon Repetitive Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20650) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20650
**Authors:** Jing Wu, Daphne Barretto, Yiye Chen, Nicholas Gyd\'e, Yanan Jian, Yuhang He, Vibhav Vineet

**Abstract:**  Long-horizon, repetitive workflows are common in professional settings, such as processing expense reports from receipts and entering student grades from exam papers. These tasks are often tedious for humans since they can extend to extreme lengths proportional to the size of the data to process. However, they are ideal for Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) due to their structured, recurring sub-workflows with logic that can be systematically learned. Identifying the absence of an evaluation benchmark as a primary bottleneck, we establish OS-Marathon, comprising 242 long-horizon, repetitive tasks across 2 domains to evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) agents. We then introduce a cost-effective method to construct a condensed demonstration using only few-shot examples to teach agents the underlying workflow logic, enabling them to execute similar workflows effectively on larger, unseen data collections. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the inherent challenges of these tasks and the effectiveness of our proposed method. Project website: https://os-marathon.github.io/.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3: introduces OS-Marathon, a new benchmark for evaluating computer-use agents on long-horizon, repetitive tasks, with a novel few-shot demonstration method. Focuses on simulator/benchmark creation for embodied agents.

## 6. [Compression Tells Intelligence: Visual Coding, Visual Token Technology, and the Unification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20742) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20742
**Authors:** Xin Jin, Jinming Liu, Yuntao Wei, Junyan Lin, Zhicheng Wang, Jianguo Huang, Xudong Yang, Yanxiao Liu, Wenjun Zeng

**Abstract:**  "Compression Tells Intelligence", is supported by research in artificial intelligence, particularly concerning (multimodal) large language models (LLMs/MLLMs), where compression efficiency often correlates with improved model performance and capabilities. For compression, classical visual coding based on traditional information theory has developed over decades, achieving great success with numerous international industrial standards widely applied in multimedia (e.g., image/video) systems. Except that, the recent emergingvisual token technology of generative multi-modal large models also shares a similar fundamental objective like visual coding: maximizing semantic information fidelity during the representation learning while minimizing computational cost. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of two dominant technique families first -- Visual Coding and Vision Token Technology -- then we further unify them from the aspect of optimization, discussing the essence of compression efficiency and model performance trade-off behind. Next, based on the proposed unified formulation bridging visual coding andvisual token technology, we synthesize bidirectional insights of themselves and forecast the next-gen visual codec and token techniques. Last but not least, we experimentally show a large potential of the task-oriented token developments in the more practical tasks like multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), AI-generated content (AIGC), and embodied AI, as well as shedding light on the future possibility of standardizing a general token technology like the traditional codecs (e.g., H.264/265) with high efficiency for a wide range of intelligent tasks in a unified and effective manner.

**Comment:** Directly matches criterion 4: Provides a comprehensive overview and unification of visual coding and visual token technology, with implications for vision foundation models and their applications, including embodied AI and MLLMs.

## 7. [OmegaUse: Building a General-Purpose GUI Agent for Autonomous Task Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20380) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20380
**Authors:** Le Zhang, Yixiong Xiao, Xinjiang Lu, Jingjia Cao, Yusai Zhao, Jingbo Zhou, Lang An, Zikan Feng, Wanxiang Sha, Yu Shi, Congxi Xiao, Jian Xiong, Yankai Zhang, Hua Wu, Haifeng Wang

**Abstract:**  Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show great potential for enabling foundation models to complete real-world tasks, revolutionizing human-computer interaction and improving human productivity. In this report, we present OmegaUse, a general-purpose GUI agent model for autonomous task execution on both mobile and desktop platforms, supporting computer-use and phone-use scenarios. Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce a carefully engineered data-construction pipeline and a decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce a novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt a two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OS-Nav, a benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu. Extensive experiments show that OmegaUse is highly competitive across established GUI benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art (SOTA) score of 96.3% on ScreenSpot-V2 and a leading 79.1% step success rate on AndroidControl. OmegaUse also performs strongly on OS-Nav, reaching 74.24% step success on ChiM-Nav and 55.9% average success on Ubu-Nav.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (embodied AI: new methods for GUI agents, new benchmarks for cross-platform task execution, and spatial grounding in agentic reasoning). Also relevant to criterion 4 (application of foundation models to GUI agents).

## 8. [Li-ViP3D++: Query-Gated Deformable Camera-LiDAR Fusion for End-to-End Perception and Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20720) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20720
**Authors:** Matej Halinkovic, Nina Masarykova, Alexey Vinel, Marek Galinski

**Abstract:**  End-to-end perception and trajectory prediction from raw sensor data is one of the key capabilities for autonomous driving. Modular pipelines restrict information flow and can amplify upstream errors. Recent query-based, fully differentiable perception-and-prediction (PnP) models mitigate these issues, yet the complementarity of cameras and LiDAR in the query-space has not been sufficiently explored. Models often rely on fusion schemes that introduce heuristic alignment and discrete selection steps which prevent full utilization of available information and can introduce unwanted bias. We propose Li-ViP3D++, a query-based multimodal PnP framework that introduces Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to integrate multi-view RGB and LiDAR in query space. QGDF (i) aggregates image evidence via masked attention across cameras and feature levels, (ii) extracts LiDAR context through fully differentiable BEV sampling with learned per-query offsets, and (iii) applies query-conditioned gating to adaptively weight visual and geometric cues per agent. The resulting architecture jointly optimizes detection, tracking, and multi-hypothesis trajectory forecasting in a single end-to-end model. On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ improves end-to-end behavior and detection quality, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502) while substantially reducing false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and it is faster than the prior Li-ViP3D variant (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms). These results indicate that query-space, fully differentiable camera-LiDAR fusion can increase robustness of end-to-end PnP without sacrificing deployability.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3: Proposes a novel, fully differentiable, query-based camera-LiDAR fusion method for end-to-end perception and prediction in autonomous driving, with a new fusion mechanism (Query-Gated Deformable Fusion) and strong empirical results.

## 9. [Feature Projection Learning for Better Vision-Language Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20224) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20224
**Authors:** Yi Zhang, Weicheng Lin, Liang-Jie Zhang

**Abstract:**  Vision-Language Pre-Trained models, notably CLIP, that utilize contrastive learning have proven highly adept at extracting generalizable visual features. To inherit the well-learned knowledge of VLP models for downstream tasks, several approaches aim to adapt them efficiently with limited supervision. However, these methods either suffer from limited performance, excessive learnable parameters, or extended training times, all of which hinder their effectiveness in adapting the CLIP model to downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a simple yet efficient and effective method called \textit{\textbf{F}eature \textbf{P}rojection \textbf{L}earning(FPL)} to address these problems. Specifically, we develop a projection model that projects class prototype features into the query image feature space and reconstructs the query image feature map. The negative average squared reconstruction error is used as the class score. In this way, we transform the classification problem into a feature projection problem. The final output of this method is a combination of the prediction from the projection model and the original pre-trained CLIP. Comprehensive empirical evaluations confirm that FPL delivers superior accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4: proposes Feature Projection Learning (FPL) for adapting vision-language foundation models (CLIP) to downstream tasks, with a novel projection-based classification method and strong empirical results.

## 10. [Investigating the Development of Task-Oriented Communication in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20641) <a id="link10"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20641
**Authors:** Boaz Carmeli, Orr Paradise, Shafi Goldwasser, Yonatan Belinkov, Ron Meir

**Abstract:**  We investigate whether \emph{LLM-based agents} can develop task-oriented communication protocols that differ from standard natural language in collaborative reasoning tasks. Our focus is on two core properties such task-oriented protocols may exhibit: Efficiency -- conveying task-relevant information more concisely than natural language, and Covertness -- becoming difficult for external observers to interpret, raising concerns about transparency and control. To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants. Experiments show that VLMs can develop effective, task-adapted communication patterns. At the same time, they can develop covert protocols that are difficult for humans and external agents to interpret. We also observe spontaneous coordination between similar models without explicitly shared protocols. These findings highlight both the potential and the risks of task-oriented communication, and position referential games as a valuable testbed for future work in this area.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2: investigates vision-language models (VLMs) in referential games, showing emergent task-oriented communication protocols and covert language, with surprising empirical findings about VLM coordination and communication efficiency.

## 11. [ProSkill: Segment-Level Skill Assessment in Procedural Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20661) <a id="link11"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20661
**Authors:** Michele Mazzamuto, Daniele Di Mauro, Gianpiero Francesca, Giovanni Maria Farinella, Antonino Furnari

**Abstract:**  Skill assessment in procedural videos is crucial for the objective evaluation of human performance in settings such as manufacturing and procedural daily tasks. Current research on skill assessment has predominantly focused on sports and lacks large-scale datasets for complex procedural activities. Existing studies typically involve only a limited number of actions, focus on either pairwise assessments (e.g., A is better than B) or on binary labels (e.g., good execution vs needs improvement). In response to these shortcomings, we introduce ProSkill, the first benchmark dataset for action-level skill assessment in procedural tasks. ProSkill provides absolute skill assessment annotations, along with pairwise ones. This is enabled by a novel and scalable annotation protocol that allows for the creation of an absolute skill assessment ranking starting from pairwise assessments. This protocol leverages a Swiss Tournament scheme for efficient pairwise comparisons, which are then aggregated into consistent, continuous global scores using an ELO-based rating system. We use our dataset to benchmark the main state-of-the-art skill assessment algorithms, including both ranking-based and pairwise paradigms. The suboptimal results achieved by the current state-of-the-art highlight the challenges and thus the value of ProSkill in the context of skill assessment for procedural videos. All data and code are available at https://fpv-iplab.github.io/ProSkill/

**Comment:** ProSkill introduces a new benchmark for segment-level skill assessment in procedural videos, with a novel annotation protocol and dataset. This matches criterion 3 (embodied AI papers on new benchmarks, especially with novel annotation/assessment angles).

## 12. [Youtu-Parsing: Perception, Structuring and Recognition via High-Parallelism Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20430) <a id="link12"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20430
**Authors:** Kun Yin, Yunfei Wu, Bing Liu, Zhongpeng Cai, Xiaotian Li, Huang Chen, Xin Li, Haoyu Cao, Yinsong Liu, Deqiang Jiang, Xing Sun, Yunsheng Wu, Qianyu Li, Antai Guo, Yanzhen Liao, Yanqiu Qu, Haodong Lin, Chengxu He, Shuangyin Liu

**Abstract:**  This paper presents Youtu-Parsing, an efficient and versatile document parsing model designed for high-performance content extraction. The architecture employs a native Vision Transformer (ViT) featuring a dynamic-resolution visual encoder to extract shared document features, coupled with a prompt-guided Youtu-LLM-2B language model for layout analysis and region-prompted decoding. Leveraging this decoupled and feature-reusable framework, we introduce a high-parallelism decoding strategy comprising two core components: token parallelism and query parallelism. The token parallelism strategy concurrently generates up to 64 candidate tokens per inference step, which are subsequently validated through a verification mechanism. This approach yields a 5--11x speedup over traditional autoregressive decoding and is particularly well-suited for highly structured scenarios, such as table recognition. To further exploit the advantages of region-prompted decoding, the query parallelism strategy enables simultaneous content prediction for multiple bounding boxes (up to five), providing an additional 2x acceleration while maintaining output quality equivalent to standard decoding. Youtu-Parsing encompasses a diverse range of document elements, including text, formulas, tables, charts, seals, and hierarchical structures. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong robustness when handling rare characters, multilingual text, and handwritten content. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-Parsing achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both the OmniDocBench and olmOCR-bench benchmarks. Overall, Youtu-Parsing demonstrates significant experimental value and practical utility for large-scale document intelligence applications.

**Authors:** Genyuan Zhang, Zihao Wang, Zhifan Gao, Lei Xu, Zhen Zhou, Haijun Yu, Jianjia Zhang, Xiujian Liu, Weiwei Zhang, Shaoyu Wang, Huazhu Fu, Fenglin Liu, Weiwen Wu

**Abstract:**  The application of iodinated contrast media (ICM) improves the sensitivity and specificity of computed tomography (CT) for a wide range of clinical indications. However, overdose of ICM can cause problems such as kidney damage and life-threatening allergic reactions. Deep learning methods can generate CT images of normal-dose ICM from low-dose ICM, reducing the required dose while maintaining diagnostic power. However, existing methods are difficult to realize accurate enhancement with incompletely paired images, mainly because of the limited ability of the model to recognize specific structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Structure-constrained Language-informed Diffusion Model (SLDM), a unified medical generation model that integrates structural synergy and spatial intelligence. First, the structural prior information of the image is effectively extracted to constrain the model inference process, thus ensuring structural consistency in the enhancement process. Subsequently, semantic supervision strategy with spatial intelligence is introduced, which integrates the functions of visual perception and spatial reasoning, thus prompting the model to achieve accurate enhancement. Finally, the subtraction angiography enhancement module is applied, which serves to improve the contrast of the ICM agent region to suitable interval for observation. Qualitative analysis of visual comparison and quantitative results of several metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in angiographic reconstruction for low-dose contrast medium CT angiography.

**Comment:** Directly matches criterion 1: Proposes a structure-constrained, language-informed diffusion model for medical imaging that integrates structural priors and spatial intelligence for improved CT angiography reconstruction.

## 14. [HINT: Hierarchical Interaction Modeling for Autoregressive Multi-Human Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20383) <a id="link14"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20383
**Authors:** Mengge Liu, Yan Di, Gu Wang, Yun Qu, Dekai Zhu, Yanyan Li, Xiangyang Ji

**Abstract:**  Text-driven multi-human motion generation with complex interactions remains a challenging problem. Despite progress in performance, existing offline methods that generate fixed-length motions with a fixed number of agents, are inherently limited in handling long or variable text, and varying agent counts. These limitations naturally encourage autoregressive formulations, which predict future motions step by step conditioned on all past trajectories and current text guidance. In this work, we introduce HINT, the first autoregressive framework for multi-human motion generation with Hierarchical INTeraction modeling in diffusion. First, HINT leverages a disentangled motion representation within a canonicalized latent space, decoupling local motion semantics from inter-person interactions. This design facilitates direct adaptation to varying numbers of human participants without requiring additional refinement. Second, HINT adopts a sliding-window strategy for efficient online generation, and aggregates local within-window and global cross-window conditions to capture past human history, inter-person dependencies, and align with text guidance. This strategy not only enables fine-grained interaction modeling within each window but also preserves long-horizon coherence across all the long sequence. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that HINT matches the performance of strong offline models and surpasses autoregressive baselines. Notably, on InterHuman, HINT achieves an FID of 3.100, significantly improving over the previous state-of-the-art score of 5.154.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4: proposes HINT, a hierarchical interaction modeling framework for text-driven multi-human motion generation using diffusion models, with a novel autoregressive approach and strong empirical results.

**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20511
**Authors:** Zelong Sun, Jiahui Wu, Ying Ba, Dong Jing, Zhiwu Lu

**Abstract:**  As social media platforms proliferate, users increasingly demand intuitive ways to create diverse, high-quality portrait collections. In this work, we introduce Portrait Collection Generation (PCG), a novel task that generates coherent portrait collections by editing a reference portrait image through natural language instructions. This task poses two unique challenges to existing methods: (1) complex multi-attribute modifications such as pose, spatial layout, and camera viewpoint; and (2) high-fidelity detail preservation including identity, clothing, and accessories. To address these challenges, we propose CHEESE, the first large-scale PCG dataset containing 24K portrait collections and 573K samples with high-quality modification text annotations, constructed through an Large Vison-Language Model-based pipeline with inversion-based verification. We further propose SCheese, a framework that combines text-guided generation with hierarchical identity and detail preservation. SCheese employs adaptive feature fusion mechanism to maintain identity consistency, and ConsistencyNet to inject fine-grained features for detail consistency. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CHEESE in advancing PCG, with SCheese achieving state-of-the-art performance.

## 16. [Let's Roll a BiFTA: Bi-refinement for Fine-grained Text-visual Alignment in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20419) <a id="link16"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20419
**Authors:** Yuhao Sun, Chengyi Cai, Jiacheng Zhang, Zesheng Ye, Xingliang Yuan, Feng Liu

**Abstract:**  Recent research has shown that aligning fine-grained text descriptions with localized image patches can significantly improve the zero-shot performance of pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP). However, we find that both fine-grained text descriptions and localized image patches often contain redundant information, making text-visual alignment less effective. In this paper, we tackle this issue from two perspectives: \emph{View Refinement} and \emph{Description refinement}, termed as \textit{\textbf{Bi}-refinement for \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{T}ext-visual \textbf{A}lignment} (BiFTA). \emph{View refinement} removes redundant image patches with high \emph{Intersection over Union} (IoU) ratios, resulting in more distinctive visual samples. \emph{Description refinement} removes redundant text descriptions with high pairwise cosine similarity, ensuring greater diversity in the remaining descriptions. BiFTA achieves superior zero-shot performance on 6 benchmark datasets for both ViT-based and ResNet-based CLIP, justifying the necessity to remove redundant information in visual-text alignment.

**Comment:** This paper introduces BiFTA, a method for fine-grained text-visual alignment in vision-language models (VLMs), specifically improving CLIP. This directly matches criterion 2 (new VLLMs/MLLMs or methods for them), and is also relevant to vision-language empirical results.

**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20196
**Authors:** Brayden Hamilton, Tim Cashmore, Peter Driscoll, Trevor Gee, Henry Williams

**Abstract:**  Marine biofouling on vessel hulls poses major ecological, economic, and biosecurity risks. Traditional survey methods rely on diver inspections, which are hazardous and limited in scalability. This work investigates automated classification of biofouling severity on the Level of Fouling (LoF) scale using both custom computer vision models and large multimodal language models (LLMs). Convolutional neural networks, transformer-based segmentation, and zero-shot LLMs were evaluated on an expert-labelled dataset from the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries. Computer vision models showed high accuracy at extreme LoF categories but struggled with intermediate levels due to dataset imbalance and image framing. LLMs, guided by structured prompts and retrieval, achieved competitive performance without training and provided interpretable outputs. The results demonstrate complementary strengths across approaches and suggest that hybrid methods integrating segmentation coverage with LLM reasoning offer a promising pathway toward scalable and interpretable biofouling assessment.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (evaluation of multimodal LLMs for vision tasks) and criterion 4 (application of vision foundation models and MLLMs to a real-world problem). Also includes hybrid methods combining segmentation and LLM reasoning.

**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20689
**Authors:** Xinyue Li, Zhichao Zhang, Zhiming Xu, Shubo Xu, Xiongkuo Min, Yitong Chen, Guangtao Zhai

**Abstract:**  Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in image quality assessment (IQA) tasks. However, adapting such large-scale models is computationally expensive and still relies on substantial Mean Opinion Score (MOS) annotations. We argue that for MLLM-based IQA, the core bottleneck lies not in the quality perception capacity of MLLMs, but in MOS scale calibration. Therefore, we propose LEAF, a Label-Efficient Image Quality Assessment Framework that distills perceptual quality priors from an MLLM teacher into a lightweight student regressor, enabling MOS calibration with minimal human supervision. Specifically, the teacher conducts dense supervision through point-wise judgments and pair-wise preferences, with an estimate of decision reliability. Guided by these signals, the student learns the teacher's quality perception patterns through joint distillation and is calibrated on a small MOS subset to align with human annotations. Experiments on both user-generated and AI-generated IQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the need for human annotations while maintaining strong MOS-aligned correlations, making lightweight IQA practical under limited annotation budgets.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2: proposes a label-efficient image quality assessment framework using MLLMs, with a distillation approach for MOS calibration, reducing annotation needs. Focuses on practical application of MLLMs.

## 19. [StructAlign: Structured Cross-Modal Alignment for Continual Text-to-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20597) <a id="link19"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20597
**Authors:** Shaokun Wang, Weili Guan, Jizhou Han, Jianlong Wu, Yupeng Hu, Liqiang Nie

**Abstract:**  Continual Text-to-Video Retrieval (CTVR) is a challenging multimodal continual learning setting, where models must incrementally learn new semantic categories while maintaining accurate text-video alignment for previously learned ones, thus making it particularly prone to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge in CTVR is feature drift, which manifests in two forms: intra-modal feature drift caused by continual learning within each modality, and non-cooperative feature drift across modalities that leads to modality misalignment. To mitigate these issues, we propose StructAlign, a structured cross-modal alignment method for CTVR. First, StructAlign introduces a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) geometry as a unified geometric prior to mitigate modality misalignment. Building upon this geometric prior, we design a cross-modal ETF alignment loss that aligns text and video features with category-level ETF prototypes, encouraging the learned representations to form an approximate simplex ETF geometry. In addition, to suppress intra-modal feature drift, we design a Cross-modal Relation Preserving loss, which leverages complementary modalities to preserve cross-modal similarity relations, providing stable relational supervision for feature updates. By jointly addressing non-cooperative feature drift across modalities and intra-modal feature drift, StructAlign effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting in CTVR. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art continual retrieval approaches.

**Comment:** StructAlign proposes a structured cross-modal alignment method for continual text-to-video retrieval, addressing catastrophic forgetting in multimodal learning. This is relevant to criterion 2 (MLLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications), with a focus on continual learning in multimodal settings.

## 20. [OSDEnhancer: Taming Real-World Space-Time Video Super-Resolution with One-Step Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20308) <a id="link20"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20308
**Authors:** Shuoyan Wei, Feng Li, Chen Zhou, Runmin Cong, Yao Zhao, Huihui Bai

**Abstract:**  Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated exceptional success in video super-resolution (VSR), showcasing a powerful capacity for generating fine-grained details. However, their potential for space-time video super-resolution (STVSR), which necessitates not only recovering realistic visual content from low-resolution to high-resolution but also improving the frame rate with coherent temporal dynamics, remains largely underexplored. Moreover, existing STVSR methods predominantly address spatiotemporal upsampling under simplified degradation assumptions, which often struggle in real-world scenarios with complex unknown degradations. Such a high demand for reconstruction fidelity and temporal consistency makes the development of a robust STVSR framework particularly non-trivial. To address these challenges, we propose OSDEnhancer, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first method to achieve real-world STVSR through an efficient one-step diffusion process. OSDEnhancer initializes essential spatiotemporal structures through a linear pre-interpolation strategy and pivots on training temporal refinement and spatial enhancement mixture of experts (TR-SE MoE), which allows distinct expert pathways to progressively learn robust, specialized representations for temporal coherence and spatial detail, further collaboratively reinforcing each other during inference. A bidirectional deformable variational autoencoder (VAE) decoder is further introduced to perform recurrent spatiotemporal aggregation and propagation, enhancing cross-frame reconstruction fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior generalization capability in real-world scenarios.

**Comment:** Relevant to generative modeling and video super-resolution, but not directly about spatial intelligence in embodied agents, VLLMs/MLLMs, or new benchmarks. Closest to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) due to its novel diffusion-based approach for real-world video super-resolution.

**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20425
**Authors:** Chenliang Zhou, Fangcheng Zhong, Weihao Xia, Albert Miao, Canberk Baykal, Cengiz Oztireli

**Abstract:**  We introduce the Quartet of Diffusions, a structure-aware point cloud generation framework that explicitly models part composition and symmetry. Unlike prior methods that treat shape generation as a holistic process or only support part composition, our approach leverages four coordinated diffusion models to learn distributions of global shape latents, symmetries, semantic parts, and their spatial assembly. This structured pipeline ensures guaranteed symmetry, coherent part placement, and diverse, high-quality outputs. By disentangling the generative process into interpretable components, our method supports fine-grained control over shape attributes, enabling targeted manipulation of individual parts while preserving global consistency. A central global latent further reinforces structural coherence across assembled parts. Our experiments show that the Quartet achieves state-of-the-art performance. To our best knowledge, this is the first 3D point cloud generation framework that fully integrates and enforces both symmetry and part priors throughout the generative process.

**Comment:** Relevant to generative modeling and spatial structure in 3D, but not directly about spatial intelligence in embodied agents or VLLMs/MLLMs. Closest to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) due to its structured generative approach for 3D point clouds.

**Authors:** Chen Zhu, Jiashu Zhu, Yanxun Li, Meiqi Wu, Bingze Song, Chubin Chen, Jiahong Wu, Xiangxiang Chu, Yangang Wang

**Abstract:**  With the rapid advancement of video generation techniques, evaluating and auditing generated videos has become increasingly crucial. Existing approaches typically offer coarse video quality scores, lacking detailed localization and categorization of specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol focusing on three key aspects affecting human perception: Appearance, Motion, and Camera. We define these axes through a taxonomy of 10 prevalent artifact categories reflecting common generative failures observed in video generation. To enable robust artifact detection and categorization, we introduce GenVID, a large-scale dataset of 80k videos generated by various state-of-the-art video generation models, each carefully annotated for the defined artifact categories. Leveraging GenVID, we develop DVAR, a Dense Video Artifact Recognition framework for fine-grained identification and classification of generative artifacts. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves artifact detection accuracy and enables effective filtering of low-quality content.

**Authors:** Hongyu Zhou, Zisen Shao, Sheng Miao, Pan Wang, Dongfeng Bai, Bingbing Liu, Yiyi Liao

**Abstract:**  Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting have advanced novel view synthesis, yet still rely on dense inputs and often degrade at extrapolated views. Recent approaches leverage generative models, such as diffusion models, to provide additional supervision, but face a trade-off between generalization and fidelity: fine-tuning diffusion models for artifact removal improves fidelity but risks overfitting, while fine-tuning-free methods preserve generalization but often yield lower fidelity. We introduce FreeFix, a fine-tuning-free approach that pushes the boundary of this trade-off by enhancing extrapolated rendering with pretrained image diffusion models. We present an interleaved 2D-3D refinement strategy, showing that image diffusion models can be leveraged for consistent refinement without relying on costly video diffusion models. Furthermore, we take a closer look at the guidance signal for 2D refinement and propose a per-pixel confidence mask to identify uncertain regions for targeted improvement. Experiments across multiple datasets show that FreeFix improves multi-frame consistency and achieves performance comparable to or surpassing fine-tuning-based methods, while retaining strong generalization ability.

**Comment:** This paper presents FreeFix, a method for improving 3D Gaussian Splatting using pretrained diffusion models, relevant to vision foundation models and their applications (criterion 4). It does not address embodied AI or VLLMs/MLLMs.

**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20306
**Authors:** Yanjie Tu, Qingsen Yan, Axi Niu, Jiacong Tang

**Abstract:**  All-in-one image restoration aims to address diverse degradation types using a single unified model. Existing methods typically rely on degradation priors to guide restoration, yet often struggle to reconstruct content in severely degraded regions. Although recent works leverage semantic information to facilitate content generation, integrating it into the shallow layers of diffusion models often disrupts spatial structures (\emph{e.g.}, blurring artifacts). To address this issue, we propose a Triple-Prior Guided Diffusion (TPGDiff) network for unified image restoration. TPGDiff incorporates degradation priors throughout the diffusion trajectory, while introducing structural priors into shallow layers and semantic priors into deep layers, enabling hierarchical and complementary prior guidance for image reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage multi-source structural cues as structural priors to capture fine-grained details and guide shallow layers representations. To complement this design, we further develop a distillation-driven semantic extractor that yields robust semantic priors, ensuring reliable high-level guidance at deep layers even under severe degradations. Furthermore, a degradation extractor is employed to learn degradation-aware priors, enabling stage-adaptive control of the diffusion process across all timesteps. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-degradation benchmarks demonstrate that TPGDiff achieves superior performance and generalization across diverse restoration scenarios. Our project page is: https://leoyjtu.github.io/tpgdiff-project.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a new hierarchical diffusion model for image restoration, leveraging structural, semantic, and degradation priors. While it is a novel generative modeling approach in computer vision, it does not directly address spatial understanding in embodied agents, VLLMs/MLLMs, or benchmarks for embodied AI. It is most relevant to vision foundation models and their applications (criterion 4).

**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20856
**Authors:** Sebastiano Monti, Carlo Nicolini, Gianni Pellegrini, Jacopo Staiano, Bruno Lepri

**Abstract:**  Although the capabilities of large language models have been increasingly tested on complex reasoning tasks, their long-horizon planning abilities have not yet been extensively investigated. In this work, we provide a systematic assessment of the planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We propose a novel benchmark based on Sokoban puzzles, intentionally simplified to isolate long-horizon planning from state persistence. Our findings reveal a consistent degradation in planning performance when more than 25 moves are required to reach the solution, suggesting a fundamental constraint on forward planning capacity. We show that equipping LRMs with Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) parsing, validation, and solving tools allows for modest improvements, suggesting inherent architectural limitations which might not be overcome by test-time scaling approaches alone.

**Comment:** Proposes a new benchmark for long-horizon planning in LLMs, but not specifically for spatial intelligence or embodied agents. Some relevance to criterion 3 (benchmarking reasoning in agents), but not a strong match.

**Authors:** Shiwen Zhang, Xiaoyan Yang, Bojia Zi, Haibin Huang, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li

**Abstract:**  Content-preserving style transfer, generating stylized outputs based on content and style references, remains a significant challenge for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) due to the inherent entanglement of content and style features in their internal representations. In this technical report, we present TeleStyle, a lightweight yet effective model for both image and video stylization. Built upon Qwen-Image-Edit, TeleStyle leverages the base model's robust capabilities in content preservation and style customization. To facilitate effective training, we curated a high-quality dataset of distinct specific styles and further synthesized triplets using thousands of diverse, in-the-wild style categories. We introduce a Curriculum Continual Learning framework to train TeleStyle on this hybrid dataset of clean (curated) and noisy (synthetic) triplets. This approach enables the model to generalize to unseen styles without compromising precise content fidelity. Additionally, we introduce a video-to-video stylization module to enhance temporal consistency and visual quality. TeleStyle achieves state-of-the-art performance across three core evaluation metrics: style similarity, content consistency, and aesthetic quality. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/Tele-AI/TeleStyle

**Authors:** Jan Niklas Kolf, Ozan Tezcan, Justin Theiss, Hyung Jun Kim, Wentao Bao, Bhargav Bhushanam, Khushi Gupta, Arun Kejariwal, Naser Damer, Fadi Boutros

**Abstract:**  The rise of Deep Generative Models (DGM) has enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic data. When used to augment authentic data in Deep Metric Learning (DML), these synthetic samples enhance intra-class diversity and improve the performance of downstream DML tasks. We introduce BLenDeR, a diffusion sampling method designed to increase intra-class diversity for DML in a controllable way by leveraging set-theory inspired union and intersection operations on denoising residuals. The union operation encourages any attribute present across multiple prompts, while the intersection extracts the common direction through a principal component surrogate. These operations enable controlled synthesis of diverse attribute combinations within each class, addressing key limitations of existing generative approaches. Experiments on standard DML benchmarks demonstrate that BLenDeR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple datasets and backbones. Specifically, BLenDeR achieves 3.7% increase in Recall@1 on CUB-200 and a 1.8% increase on Cars-196, compared to state-of-the-art baselines under standard experimental settings.

**Authors:** Hang Guo, Zhaoyang Jia, Jiahao Li, Bin Li, Yuanhao Cai, Jiangshan Wang, Yawei Li, Yan Lu

**Abstract:**  The autoregressive video diffusion model has recently gained considerable research interest due to its causal modeling and iterative denoising. In this work, we identify that the multi-head self-attention in these models under-utilizes historical frames: approximately 25% heads attend almost exclusively to the current frame, and discarding their KV caches incurs only minor performance degradation. Building upon this, we propose Dummy Forcing, a simple yet effective method to control context accessibility across different heads. Specifically, the proposed heterogeneous memory allocation reduces head-wise context redundancy, accompanied by dynamic head programming to adaptively classify head types. Moreover, we develop a context packing technique to achieve more aggressive cache compression. Without additional training, our Dummy Forcing delivers up to 2.0x speedup over the baseline, supporting video generation at 24.3 FPS with less than 0.5% quality drop. Project page is available at https://csguoh.github.io/project/DummyForcing/.

**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20379
**Authors:** Zhengbo Jiao, Hongyu Xian, Qinglong Wang, Yunpu Ma, Zhebo Wang, Zifan Zhang, Dezhang Kong, Meng Han

**Abstract:**  Large language models (LLMs) struggle with complex, long-horizon reasoning due to instability caused by their frozen policy assumption. Current test-time scaling methods treat execution feedback merely as an external signal for filtering or rewriting trajectories, without internalizing it to improve the underlying reasoning strategy. Inspired by Popper's epistemology of "conjectures and refutations," we argue that intelligence requires real-time evolution of the model's policy through learning from failed attempts. We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process. PoT first generates diverse candidate solutions via an efficient exploration mechanism, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update a transient LoRA adapter based on execution feedback. This closed-loop design enables dynamic, instance-specific refinement of the model's reasoning priors. Experiments show that PoT dramatically boosts performance: a 4B model achieves 49.71% accuracy on LiveCodeBench, outperforming GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 despite being over 50 smaller.

**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20364
**Authors:** Zhen Liu, Diedong Feng, Hai Jiang, Liaoyuan Zeng, Hao Wang, Chaoyu Feng, Lei Lei, Bing Zeng, Shuaicheng Liu

**Abstract:**  RGB-to-RAW reconstruction, or the reverse modeling of a camera Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline, aims to recover high-fidelity RAW data from RGB images. Despite notable progress, existing learning-based methods typically treat this task as a direct regression objective and struggle with detail inconsistency and color deviation, due to the ill-posed nature of inverse ISP and the inherent information loss in quantized RGB images. To address these limitations, we pioneer a generative perspective by reformulating RGB-to-RAW reconstruction as a deterministic latent transport problem and introduce a novel framework named RAW-Flow, which leverages flow matching to learn a deterministic vector field in latent space, to effectively bridge the gap between RGB and RAW representations and enable accurate reconstruction of structural details and color information. To further enhance latent transport, we introduce a cross-scale context guidance module that injects hierarchical RGB features into the flow estimation process. Moreover, we design a dual-domain latent autoencoder with a feature alignment constraint to support the proposed latent transport framework, which jointly encodes RGB and RAW inputs while promoting stable training and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAW-Flow outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and visually.

**Comment:** RAW-Flow introduces a generative latent flow matching approach for RGB-to-RAW image reconstruction. While it is a novel generative modeling method in computer vision, it does not address spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models directly.

**Authors:** Weiquan Huang, Zixuan Wang, Hehai Lin, Sudong Wang, Bo Xu, Qian Li, Beier Zhu, Linyi Yang, Chengwei Qin

**Abstract:**  The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has necessitated robust memory systems to support cohesive long-term interaction and complex reasoning. Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing. The Judge verifies the relevance and consistency of retrieved content, triggering iterative retrieval when evidence is insufficient or invoking the Refresher upon detecting logical conflicts. The Refresher then enforces memory consistency by performing targeted updates or removing outdated entries. Extensive experiments on challenging long-context benchmarks show that AMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while reducing token consumption by approximately 80% compared to full-context methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining retrieval precision and long-term memory consistency.

## 32. [A Source-Free Approach for Domain Adaptation via Multiview Image Transformation and Latent Space Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20284) <a id="link32"></a>

**Abstract:**  Domain adaptation (DA) addresses the challenge of transferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain where image data distributions may differ. Existing DA methods often require access to source domain data, adversarial training, or complex pseudo-labeling techniques, which are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel source-free domain adaptation method. It is the first approach to use multiview augmentation and latent space consistency techniques to learn domain-invariant features directly from the target domain. Our method eliminates the need for source-target alignment or pseudo-label refinement by learning transferable representations solely from the target domain by enforcing consistency between multiple augmented views in the latent space. Additionally, the method ensures consistency in the learned features by generating multiple augmented views of target domain data and minimizing the distance between their feature representations in the latent space. We also introduce a ConvNeXt-based encoder and design a loss function that combines classification and consistency objectives to drive effective adaptation directly from the target domain. The proposed model achieves an average classification accuracy of 90. 72\%, 84\%, and 97. 12\% in Office-31, Office-Home and Office-Caltech datasets, respectively. Further evaluations confirm that our study improves existing methods by an average classification accuracy increment of +1.23\%, +7.26\%, and +1.77\% on the respective datasets.

**Comment:** Does not directly match any specific criterion. Focuses on source-free domain adaptation using multiview augmentation and latent space consistency, not specifically on spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

## 33. [Insight Agents: An LLM-Based Multi-Agent System for Data Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20048) <a id="link33"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.20048
**Authors:** Jincheng Bai, Zhenyu Zhang, Jennifer Zhang, Zhihuai Zhu

**Abstract:**  Today, E-commerce sellers face several key challenges, including difficulties in discovering and effectively utilizing available programs and tools, and struggling to understand and utilize rich data from various tools. We therefore aim to develop Insight Agents (IA), a conversational multi-agent Data Insight system, to provide E-commerce sellers with personalized data and business insights through automated information retrieval. Our hypothesis is that IA will serve as a force multiplier for sellers, thereby driving incremental seller adoption by reducing the effort required and increase speed at which sellers make good business decisions. In this paper, we introduce this novel LLM-backed end-to-end agentic system built on a plan-and-execute paradigm and designed for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and low latency. It features a hierarchical multi-agent structure, consisting of manager agent and two worker agents: data presentation and insight generation, for efficient information retrieval and problem-solving. We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency. Within the two worker agents, a strategic planning is designed for API-based data model that breaks down queries into granular components to generate more accurate responses, and domain knowledge is dynamically injected to to enhance the insight generator. IA has been launched for Amazon sellers in US, which has achieved high accuracy of 90% based on human evaluation, with latency of P90 below 15s.

**Comment:** Does not directly match any specific criterion. Focuses on LLM-based multi-agent systems for data insights in e-commerce, not spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI benchmarks, or vision foundation models.
