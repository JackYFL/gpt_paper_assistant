## 0. [From Frames to Clips: Efficient Key Clip Selection for Long-Form Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02262) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.02262
**Authors:** Guangyu Sun, Archit Singhal, Burak Uzkent, Mubarak Shah, Chen Chen, Garin Kessler

**Abstract:**  Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the "needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips, which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and 10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world video understanding applications. Project webpage is available at https://guangyusun.com/f2c .

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 and 4. This paper proposes F2C, a new method for efficient key clip selection in long-form video understanding for video large language models (VLMs), addressing the challenge of temporal coherence and token budget. It is directly relevant to vision foundation models and their application to video understanding.

## 1. [Agentic Jigsaw Interaction Learning for Enhancing Visual Perception and Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01304) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.01304
**Authors:** Yu Zeng, Wenxuan Huang, Shiting Huang, Xikun Bao, Yukun Qi, Yiming Zhao, Qiuchen Wang, Lin Chen, Zehui Chen, Huaian Chen, Wanli Ouyang, Feng Zhao

**Abstract:**  Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks, existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion. Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g., increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement learning data. The code and datasets is available at https://github.com/yuzeng0-0/AGILE .

**Comment:** Matches criteria 1 and 3. This paper introduces AGILE, a new agentic jigsaw interaction learning framework for vision-language models, focusing on improving spatial reasoning and perception through interactive, environment-based learning. It also provides a new scalable solution for multimodal reinforcement learning data, which is a novel methodological improvement for spatial intelligence in embodied agents.

## 2. [VLA-R1: Enhancing Reasoning in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01623) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.01623
**Authors:** Angen Ye, Zeyu Zhang, Boyuan Wang, Xiaofeng Wang, Dapeng Zhang, Zheng Zhu

**Abstract:**  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations. Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy. Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1. Website: https://gigaai-research.github.io/VLA-R1.

**Comment:** This paper directly matches criterion 1 (spatial understanding on embodied agents), criterion 2 (VLLMs/MLLMs), and criterion 3 (embodied AI with new methods and benchmarks). It introduces VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced vision-language-action model, with a new dataset and RL-based optimization for reasoning and execution in embodied AI. It also provides a new benchmark and dataset (VLA-CoT-13K).

## 3. [Just Do It!? Computer-Use Agents Exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01670) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.01670
**Authors:** Erfan Shayegani, Keegan Hines, Yue Dong, Nael Abu-Ghazaleh, Roman Lutz, Spencer Whitehead, Vidhisha Balachandran, Besmira Nushi, Vibhav Vineet

**Abstract:**  Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii) assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models, including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists, highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions. Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias (focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect (execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3. This paper introduces BLIND-ACT, a new benchmark for evaluating computer-use agents' goal-directedness and risk, built on a realistic simulator (OSWorld). It provides a novel angle on agent evaluation and highlights overlooked risks in embodied agent deployment.

## 4. [MultiModal Action Conditioned Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02287) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.02287
**Authors:** Yichen Li, Antonio Torralba

**Abstract:**  Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control. General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our work.

**Comment:** This paper introduces a multimodal action-conditioned video generation framework for simulating fine-grained multisensory actions, with applications to embodied agents and world models. This matches criterion 1 (spatial intelligence on embodied agents) and criterion 3 (novel methods for embodied AI).

## 5. [microCLIP: Unsupervised CLIP Adaptation via Coarse-Fine Token Fusion for Fine-Grained Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02270) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.02270
**Authors:** Sathira Silva, Eman Ali, Chetan Arora, Muhammad Haris Khan

**Abstract:**  Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks. Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model (LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP) within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided $\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling, and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation. Our code is available at https://github.com/sathiiii/microCLIP.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new VLLMs/MLLMs): Proposes microCLIP, an unsupervised adaptation of CLIP (a vision-language model) for fine-grained image classification, with novel token fusion and adaptation strategies.

## 6. [VaPR -- Vision-language Preference alignment for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01700) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.01700
**Authors:** Rohan Wadhawan, Fabrice Y Harel-Canada, Zi-Yi Dou, Suhaila Shakiah, Robinson Piramuthu, Nanyun Peng

**Abstract:**  Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families: LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on \name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be found on the project page https://vap-r.github.io

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2. This paper introduces VaPR, a new dataset and framework for preference alignment in large vision-language models (LVLMs), with a focus on improving reasoning and reducing bias. It provides new empirical insights and a scalable method for preference finetuning in VLLMs.

## 7. [DragFlow: Unleashing DiT Priors with Region Based Supervision for Drag Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02253) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.02253
**Authors:** Zihan Zhou, Shilin Lu, Shuli Leng, Shaocong Zhang, Zhuming Lian, Xinlei Yu, Adams Wai-Kin Kong

**Abstract:**  Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion, are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly: unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm, where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities. For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench) featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications): Proposes DragFlow, a new framework for drag-based image editing leveraging DiT priors and MLLMs for task disambiguation, and introduces a new benchmark.

## 8. [Unlocking Vision-Language Models for Video Anomaly Detection via Fine-Grained Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02155) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.02155
**Authors:** Shu Zou, Xinyu Tian, Lukas Wesemann, Fabian Waschkowski, Zhaoyuan Yang, Jing Zhang

**Abstract:**  Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for explainable video anomaly detection.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2. This paper proposes ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework for adapting frozen vision-language models (VLMs) to video anomaly detection, with a focus on fine-grained, interpretable reasoning. It demonstrates new empirical results and prompt engineering for VLMs in video understanding.

## 9. [Look Less, Reason More: Rollout-Guided Adaptive Pixel-Space Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01681) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.01681
**Authors:** Xuchen Li, Xuzhao Li, Jiahui Gao, Renjie Pi, Shiyu Hu, Wentao Zhang

**Abstract:**  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by 66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a new framework for adaptive pixel-space reasoning in VLMs, using rollout-guided reinforcement learning to improve fine-grained visual reasoning. This matches criterion 2 (new VLLMs/MLLMs) and is relevant to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications).

## 10. [Data Selection for Fine-tuning Vision Language Models via Cross Modal Alignment Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01454) <a id="link10"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.01454
**Authors:** Nilay Naharas, Dang Nguyen, Nesihan Bulut, Mohammadhossein Bateni, Vahab Mirrokni, Baharan Mirzasoleiman

**Abstract:**  Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at https://bigml-cs-ucla.github.io/XMAS-project-page/.

**Comment:** This paper proposes XMAS, a principled data selection method for fine-tuning vision-language models (LVLMs) based on cross-modal alignment trajectories. This directly matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) and is relevant to criterion 2 (VLLMs/MLLMs).

## 11. [MedQ-Bench: Evaluating and Exploring Medical Image Quality Assessment Abilities in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01691) <a id="link11"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.01691
**Authors:** Jiyao Liu, Jinjie Wei, Wanying Qu, Chenglong Ma, Junzhi Ning, Yunheng Li, Ying Chen, Xinzhe Luo, Pengcheng Chen, Xin Gao, Ming Hu, Huihui Xu, Xin Wang, Shujian Gao, Dingkang Yang, Zhongying Deng, Jin Ye, Lihao Liu, Junjun He, Ningsheng Xu

**Abstract:**  Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar, score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2) MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks, aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes, totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills, with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

**Comment:** This paper introduces MedQ-Bench, a new benchmark for evaluating medical image quality assessment abilities in MLLMs, directly matching criterion 3 (new benchmarks for embodied AI or MLLMs) and criterion 2 (new MLLMs).

## 12. [Towards Better Optimization For Listwise Preference in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01540) <a id="link12"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.01540
**Authors:** Jiamu Bai, Xin Yu, Meilong Xu, Weitao Lu, Xin Pan, Kiwan Maeng, Daniel Kifer, Jian Wang, Yu Wang

**Abstract:**  Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences. Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences. The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed. In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications): Proposes Diffusion-LPO, a new listwise preference optimization method for diffusion models, which are vision foundation models, and demonstrates improved alignment with human preferences.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.01448
**Authors:** Angel Daruna, Nicholas Meegan, Han-Pang Chiu, Supun Samarasekera, Rakesh Kumar

**Abstract:**  Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the combination of geographic and visual representations.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (spatial understanding on embodied agents): Proposes a new method for geo-localization using semantic fusion and hierarchical geographic embeddings, which is a methodological improvement in spatial understanding.

## 14. [TempoControl: Temporal Attention Guidance for Text-to-Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02226) <a id="link14"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.02226
**Authors:** Shira Schiber, Ofir Lindenbaum, Idan Schwartz

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications, including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as action and audio-aligned generation.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications): Proposes a new method (TempoControl) for temporal attention guidance in text-to-video diffusion models, which are vision foundation models.

## 15. [Foundation Visual Encoders Are Secretly Few-Shot Anomaly Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01934) <a id="link15"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.01934
**Authors:** Guangyao Zhai, Yue Zhou, Xinyan Deng, Lars Heckler, Nassir Navab, Benjamin Busam

**Abstract:**  Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly detection.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications), as it explores foundation visual encoders (e.g., DINOv3) for few-shot anomaly detection and demonstrates a new use case for foundation models.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.02283
**Authors:** Justin Cui, Jie Wu, Ming Li, Tao Yang, Xiaojie Li, Rui Wang, Andrew Bai, Yuanhao Ban, Cho-Jui Hsieh

**Abstract:**  Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos. Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to 20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency. Our long-horizon videos demo can be found at https://self-forcing-plus-plus.github.io/

**Comment:** This paper introduces Self-Forcing++, a new approach for long-horizon video generation using diffusion models. While it is highly relevant to generative modeling and video generation, it does not directly address spatial intelligence in embodied agents, VLLMs/MLLMs, or vision foundation models, but is of interest for its generative modeling advances.

**Authors:** Yang Yao, Yixu Wang, Yuxuan Zhang, Yi Lu, Tianle Gu, Lingyu Li, Dingyi Zhao, Keming Wu, Haozhe Wang, Ping Nie, Yan Teng, Yingchun Wang

**Abstract:**  Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents (DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition, cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively. This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises 214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.01339
**Authors:** Alessio Spagnoletti, Andr\'es Almansa, Marcelo Pereyra

**Abstract:**  Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular, state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

**Abstract:**  LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios, AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added system overhead.

**Comment:** This paper presents a co-evolutionary multi-agent RL framework for internalizing safety in LLM-based multi-agent systems. It is relevant to embodied AI (criterion 3) as it deals with multi-agent RL and adversarial co-evolution, introducing a new method for safety in multi-agent systems, which is a novel angle.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.01767
**Authors:** Sheng-Hsiang Hung, Ting-Yu Yen, Wei-Fang Sun, Simon See, Shih-Hsuan Hung, Hung-Kuo Chu

**Abstract:**  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However, scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i) partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

**Comment:** This paper introduces a new method for efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting for large-scale scene reconstruction. It is relevant to spatial understanding and large-scale 3D scene modeling, which is related to criterion 1 (spatial understanding for embodied agents), though it does not directly address embodied agents. It is also relevant to vision foundation models in 3D scene understanding (criterion 4).

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.02266
**Authors:** Shiyi Zhang, Dong Liang, Yihang Zhou

**Abstract:**  Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms. Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion: AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a new lightweight framework for cross-subject fMRI visual reconstruction using diffusion models and CLIP adapters. It leverages vision foundation models (CLIP, Stable Diffusion) for brain decoding, which matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications).

## 22. [An Efficient Deep Template Matching and In-Plane Pose Estimation Method via Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01678) <a id="link22"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.01678
**Authors:** Ke Jia, Ji Zhou, Hanxin Li, Zhigan Zhou, Haojie Chu, Xiaojie Li

**Abstract:**  In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state (rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile, most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications. The code is available at:https://github.com/ZhouJ6610/PoseMatch-TDCM.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.01272
**Authors:** Kunal Jha, Aydan Yuenan Huang, Eric Ye, Natasha Jaques, Max Kleiman-Weiner

**Abstract:**  Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as 50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the real-world.

**Comment:** This paper introduces ROTE, a new algorithm for modeling others' minds as code, using LLMs and probabilistic inference. It is relevant to embodied AI and human behavior prediction, but does not focus on spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, or vision foundation models. It is more about social reasoning and program synthesis.

**Authors:** Xiaoyang Liu, Zhengyan Zhou, Zihang Xu, Jiezhang Cao, Zheng Chen, Yulun Zhang

**Abstract:**  Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However, challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/FideDiff.

**Authors:** Villanelle O'Reilly, Jonathan Cox, Georgios Leontidis, Marc Hanheide, Petra Bosilj, James Brown

**Abstract:**  Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11 underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains, demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset, highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable ecological insights.

**Comment:** This paper presents a new multicategory crowd counting framework using a vision transformer backbone and a segmentation-based module. While it is relevant to computer vision and introduces a new method for density estimation, it does not directly address spatial intelligence in embodied agents, VLLMs/MLLMs, or vision foundation models.

**Authors:** Yifan Zhao, Liangchen Li, Yuqi Zhou, Kai Wang, Yan Liang, Juyong Zhang

**Abstract:**  Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and 3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information. However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.01498
**Authors:** Yuxuan Ou, Ning Bi, Jiazhen Pan, Jiancheng Yang, Boliang Yu, Usama Zidan, Regent Lee, Vicente Grau

**Abstract:**  While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks, including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning, enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of 264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61 dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation, it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to nnU-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxuanou623/AortaDiff.git.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.02263
**Authors:** Yuxiao Qu, Anikait Singh, Yoonho Lee, Amrith Setlur, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Chelsea Finn, Aviral Kumar

**Abstract:**  Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them. While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in guiding meaningful exploration.

**Authors:** Zhihao Dou, Qinjian Zhao, Zhongwei Wan, Dinggen Zhang, Weida Wang, Towsif Raiyan, Benteng Chen, Qingtao Pan, Yang Ouyang, Zhiqiang Gao, Shufei Zhang, Sumon Biswas

**Abstract:**  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL), attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge, we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks, validating its effectiveness and generalization.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a two-stage framework for LLM reasoning with high-level planning and RL optimization. While it is a novel method for LLM reasoning, it does not address spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

**Abstract:**  Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse, outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

**Comment:** This paper introduces a new RL algorithm for diffusion language models to improve reasoning, with a focus on step-wise policy optimization. While it is a novel method for LLMs, it does not address spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

## 31. [Towards Interpretable and Inference-Optimal COT Reasoning with Sparse Autoencoder-Guided Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01528) <a id="link31"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.01528
**Authors:** Daniel Zhao, Abhilash Shankarampeta, Lanxiang Hu, Tajana Rosing, Hao Zhang

**Abstract:**  We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks. Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning process in LLMs.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a method using sparse autoencoders and clustering to analyze and guide LLM reasoning, focusing on mathematical reasoning. It does not address spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models. It is more about LLM interpretability.

## 32. [Uncovering Overconfident Failures in CXR Models via Augmentation-Sensitivity Risk Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01683) <a id="link32"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.01683
**Authors:** Han-Jay Shu, Wei-Ning Chiu, Shun-Ting Chang, Meng-Ping Huang, Takeshi Tohyama, Ahram Han, Po-Chih Kuo

**Abstract:**  Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR) interpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm 15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$) despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in medical AI.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a new augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring framework for identifying error-prone cases in chest radiograph models. While it introduces a novel statistical trick for model reliability, it does not directly address spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models. It is more focused on medical imaging reliability.

## 33. [FlexDoc: Parameterized Sampling for Diverse Multilingual Synthetic Documents for Training Document Understanding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02133) <a id="link33"></a>

**Authors:** Karan Dua, Hitesh Laxmichand Patel, Puneet Mittal, Ranjeet Gupta, Amit Agarwal, Praneet Pabolu, Srikant Panda, Hansa Meghwani, Graham Horwood, Fahad Shah

**Abstract:**  Developing document understanding models at enterprise scale requires large, diverse, and well-annotated datasets spanning a wide range of document types. However, collecting such data is prohibitively expensive due to privacy constraints, legal restrictions, and the sheer volume of manual annotation needed - costs that can scale into millions of dollars. We introduce FlexDoc, a scalable synthetic data generation framework that combines Stochastic Schemas and Parameterized Sampling to produce realistic, multilingual semi-structured documents with rich annotations. By probabilistically modeling layout patterns, visual structure, and content variability, FlexDoc enables the controlled generation of diverse document variants at scale. Experiments on Key Information Extraction (KIE) tasks demonstrate that FlexDoc-generated data improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets, while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional hard-template methods. The solution is in active deployment, where it has accelerated the development of enterprise-grade document understanding models while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs.

**Comment:** Does not match any specific criterion; focuses on synthetic document generation for document understanding, not spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

## 34. [Consistent Assistant Domains Transformer for Source-free Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01559) <a id="link34"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.01559
**Authors:** Renrong Shao, Wei Zhang, Kangyang Luo, Qin Li, and Jun Wang

**Abstract:**  Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly. However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency. Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions, which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our proposed approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/RoryShao/CADTrans.git.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a new transformer-based method for source-free domain adaptation, which is relevant to computer vision and machine learning, but does not directly address spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models. It is a general CV/ML method.
