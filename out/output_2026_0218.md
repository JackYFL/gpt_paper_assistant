## 0. [How Vision Becomes Language: A Layer-wise Information-Theoretic Analysis of Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15580) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15580
**Authors:** Hongxuan Wu, Yukun Zhang, Xueqing Zhou

**Abstract:**  When a multimodal Transformer answers a visual question, is the prediction driven by visual evidence, linguistic reasoning, or genuinely fused cross-modal computation -- and how does this structure evolve across layers? We address this question with a layer-wise framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that decomposes the predictive information at each Transformer layer into redundant, vision-unique, language-unique, and synergistic components. To make PID tractable for high-dimensional neural representations, we introduce \emph{PID Flow}, a pipeline combining dimensionality reduction, normalizing-flow Gaussianization, and closed-form Gaussian PID estimation. Applying this framework to LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.6-7B across six GQA reasoning tasks, we uncover a consistent \emph{modal transduction} pattern: visual-unique information peaks early and decays with depth, language-unique information surges in late layers to account for roughly 82\% of the final prediction, and cross-modal synergy remains below 2\%. This trajectory is highly stable across model variants (layer-wise correlations $>$0.96) yet strongly task-dependent, with semantic redundancy governing the detailed information fingerprint. To establish causality, we perform targeted Image$\rightarrow$Question attention knockouts and show that disrupting the primary transduction pathway induces predictable increases in trapped visual-unique information, compensatory synergy, and total information cost -- effects that are strongest in vision-dependent tasks and weakest in high-redundancy tasks. Together, these results provide an information-theoretic, causal account of how vision becomes language in multimodal Transformers, and offer quantitative guidance for identifying architectural bottlenecks where modality-specific information is lost.

**Comment:** This paper presents a layer-wise information-theoretic analysis of multimodal reasoning in Transformers, using Partial Information Decomposition to analyze how vision becomes language in VLMs. It matches criterion 2 (VLLMs/MLLMs) and provides surprising empirical insights into vision-language models, which aligns with your friend's interests.

## 1. [Zero-shot HOI Detection with MLLM-based Detector-agnostic Interaction Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15124) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15124
**Authors:** Shiyu Xuan, Dongkai Wang, Zechao Li, Jinhui Tang

**Abstract:**  Zero-shot Human-object interaction (HOI) detection aims to locate humans and objects in images and recognize their interactions. While advances in open-vocabulary object detection provide promising solutions for object localization, interaction recognition (IR) remains challenging due to the combinatorial diversity of interactions. Existing methods, including two-stage methods, tightly couple IR with a specific detector and rely on coarse-grained vision-language model (VLM) features, which limit generalization to unseen interactions. In this work, we propose a decoupled framework that separates object detection from IR and leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for zero-shot IR. We introduce a deterministic generation method that formulates IR as a visual question answering task and enforces deterministic outputs, enabling training-free zero-shot IR. To further enhance performance and efficiency by fine-tuning the model, we design a spatial-aware pooling module that integrates appearance and pairwise spatial cues, and a one-pass deterministic matching method that predicts all candidate interactions in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO demonstrate that our method achieves superior zero-shot performance, strong cross-dataset generalization, and the flexibility to integrate with any object detectors without retraining. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/SY-Xuan/DA-HOI.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new MLLMs) and criterion 3 (embodied AI/new methods for spatial understanding). Proposes a decoupled, detector-agnostic zero-shot HOI detection framework using MLLMs for interaction recognition, with a spatial-aware pooling module and strong cross-dataset generalization.

## 2. [Learning to Retrieve Navigable Candidates for Efficient Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15724) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15724
**Authors:** Shutian Gu, Chengkai Huang, Ruoyu Wang, Lina Yao

**Abstract:**  Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to follow natural-language instructions and navigate through previously unseen environments. Recent approaches increasingly employ large language models (LLMs) as high-level navigators due to their flexibility and reasoning capability. However, prompt-based LLM navigation often suffers from inefficient decision-making, as the model must repeatedly interpret instructions from scratch and reason over noisy and verbose navigable candidates at each step. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented framework to improve the efficiency and stability of LLM-based VLN without modifying or fine-tuning the underlying language model. Our approach introduces retrieval at two complementary levels. At the episode level, an instruction-level embedding retriever selects semantically similar successful navigation trajectories as in-context exemplars, providing task-specific priors for instruction grounding. At the step level, an imitation-learned candidate retriever prunes irrelevant navigable directions before LLM inference, reducing action ambiguity and prompt complexity. Both retrieval modules are lightweight, modular, and trained independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method on the Room-to-Room (R2R) benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in Success Rate, Oracle Success Rate, and SPL on both seen and unseen environments. Ablation studies further show that instruction-level exemplar retrieval and candidate pruning contribute complementary benefits to global guidance and step-wise decision efficiency. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented decision support is an effective and scalable strategy for enhancing LLM-based vision-and-language navigation.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a retrieval-augmented framework for efficient Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) using LLMs, with episode-level and step-level retrieval modules. It matches criterion 1 (spatial understanding on embodied agents) and criterion 3 (embodied AI, new methods for navigation), as it introduces a novel method for improving LLM-based navigation in unseen environments.

## 3. [EventMemAgent: Hierarchical Event-Centric Memory for Online Video Understanding with Adaptive Tool Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15329) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15329
**Authors:** Siwei Wen, Zhangcheng Wang, Xingjian Zhang, Lei Huang, Wenjun Wu

**Abstract:**  Online video understanding requires models to perform continuous perception and long-range reasoning within potentially infinite visual streams. Its fundamental challenge lies in the conflict between the unbounded nature of streaming media input and the limited context window of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods primarily rely on passive processing, which often face a trade-off between maintaining long-range context and capturing the fine-grained details necessary for complex tasks. To address this, we introduce EventMemAgent, an active online video agent framework based on a hierarchical memory module. Our framework employs a dual-layer strategy for online videos: short-term memory detects event boundaries and utilizes event-granular reservoir sampling to process streaming video frames within a fixed-length buffer dynamically; long-term memory structuredly archives past observations on an event-by-event basis. Furthermore, we integrate a multi-granular perception toolkit for active, iterative evidence capture and employ Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) to end-to-end internalize reasoning and tool-use strategies into the agent's intrinsic capabilities. Experiments show that EventMemAgent achieves competitive results on online video benchmarks. The code will be released here: https://github.com/lingcco/EventMemAgent.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (embodied AI, new methods for online video understanding with hierarchical memory and adaptive tool use) and criterion 2 (MLLMs) via a novel agent framework for long-range video reasoning.

## 4. [Revealing and Enhancing Core Visual Regions: Harnessing Internal Attention Dynamics for Hallucination Mitigation in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15556) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15556
**Authors:** Guangtao Lyu, Qi Liu, Chenghao Xu, Jiexi Yan, Muli Yang, Xueting Li, Fen Fang, Cheng Deng

**Abstract:**  LVLMs have achieved strong multimodal reasoning capabilities but remain prone to hallucinations, producing outputs inconsistent with visual inputs or user instructions. Existing training-free methods, including contrastive decoding and auxiliary expert models, which incur several times more computational overhead and may introduce potential interference, as well as static internal signal enhancement, are often vulnerable to the attention sink phenomenon. We find that internal Positive Attention Dynamics (PAD) in LVLMs naturally reveal semantically core visual regions under the distortions of attention sinks. Based on this, we propose Positive Attention Dynamics Enhancement (PADE), a training-free attention intervention that constructs a PAD map to identify semantically core visual regions, applies per-head Median Absolute Deviation Scaling to adaptively control the intervention strength, and leverages System-Token Compensation to maintain attention to complex user instructions and support long-term output consistency. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that PADE improves visual grounding and reduces hallucinations, validating the effectiveness of leveraging internal attention dynamics for reliable multimodal reasoning.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (VLLMs/MLLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) by proposing a novel, training-free method to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs using internal attention dynamics.

## 5. [Visual Persuasion: What Influences Decisions of Vision-Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15278) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15278
**Authors:** Manuel Cherep, Pranav M R, Pattie Maes, Nikhil Singh

**Abstract:**  The web is littered with images, once created for human consumption and now increasingly interpreted by agents using vision-language models (VLMs). These agents make visual decisions at scale, deciding what to click, recommend, or buy. Yet, we know little about the structure of their visual preferences. We introduce a framework for studying this by placing VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks and systematically perturbing their inputs. Our key idea is to treat the agent's decision function as a latent visual utility that can be inferred through revealed preference: choices between systematically edited images. Starting from common images, such as product photos, we propose methods for visual prompt optimization, adapting text optimization methods to iteratively propose and apply visually plausible modifications using an image generation model (such as in composition, lighting, or background). We then evaluate which edits increase selection probability. Through large-scale experiments on frontier VLMs, we demonstrate that optimized edits significantly shift choice probabilities in head-to-head comparisons. We develop an automatic interpretability pipeline to explain these preferences, identifying consistent visual themes that drive selection. We argue that this approach offers a practical and efficient way to surface visual vulnerabilities, safety concerns that might otherwise be discovered implicitly in the wild, supporting more proactive auditing and governance of image-based AI agents.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (VLLMs/MLLMs) by analyzing and probing visual decision-making in vision-language models, and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) via interpretability and safety auditing.

## 6. [VideoSketcher: Video Models Prior Enable Versatile Sequential Sketch Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15819) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15819
**Authors:** Hui Ren, Yuval Alaluf, Omer Bar Tal, Alexander Schwing, Antonio Torralba, Yael Vinker

**Abstract:**  Sketching is inherently a sequential process, in which strokes are drawn in a meaningful order to explore and refine ideas. However, most generative models treat sketches as static images, overlooking the temporal structure that underlies creative drawing. We present a data-efficient approach for sequential sketch generation that adapts pretrained text-to-video diffusion models to generate sketching processes. Our key insight is that large language models and video diffusion models offer complementary strengths for this task: LLMs provide semantic planning and stroke ordering, while video diffusion models serve as strong renderers that produce high-quality, temporally coherent visuals. We leverage this by representing sketches as short videos in which strokes are progressively drawn on a blank canvas, guided by text-specified ordering instructions. We introduce a two-stage fine-tuning strategy that decouples the learning of stroke ordering from the learning of sketch appearance. Stroke ordering is learned using synthetic shape compositions with controlled temporal structure, while visual appearance is distilled from as few as seven manually authored sketching processes that capture both global drawing order and the continuous formation of individual strokes. Despite the extremely limited amount of human-drawn sketch data, our method generates high-quality sequential sketches that closely follow text-specified orderings while exhibiting rich visual detail. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach through extensions such as brush style conditioning and autoregressive sketch generation, enabling additional controllability and interactive, collaborative drawing.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) and partially criterion 2 (shows new use of video diffusion models and LLMs for multi-modal sequential sketch generation). The paper adapts pretrained text-to-video diffusion models and LLMs for sequential sketch generation, introducing a two-stage fine-tuning strategy and demonstrating data-efficient learning with very limited human data. This is a novel application of vision foundation models and multi-modal learning.

## 7. [Efficient Generative Modeling beyond Memoryless Diffusion via Adjoint Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15396) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15396
**Authors:** Jeongwoo Shin, Jinhwan Sul, Joonseok Lee, Jaewong Choi, Jaemoo Choi

**Abstract:**  Diffusion models often yield highly curved trajectories and noisy score targets due to an uninformative, memoryless forward process that induces independent data-noise coupling. We propose Adjoint Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (ASBM), a generative modeling framework that recovers optimal trajectories in high dimensions via two stages. First, we view the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) forward dynamic as a coupling construction problem and learn it through a data-to-energy sampling perspective that transports data to an energy-defined prior. Then, we learn the backward generative dynamic with a simple matching loss supervised by the induced optimal coupling. By operating in a non-memoryless regime, ASBM produces significantly straighter and more efficient sampling paths. Compared to prior works, ASBM scales to high-dimensional data with notably improved stability and efficiency. Extensive experiments on image generation show that ASBM improves fidelity with fewer sampling steps. We further showcase the effectiveness of our optimal trajectory via distillation to a one-step generator.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (new methodological improvements to generative modeling, which is a core part of spatial intelligence in embodied agents) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models related and its applications, as it proposes a new generative modeling framework for images). The paper introduces Adjoint Schrödinger Bridge Matching, a novel generative modeling framework that improves sampling efficiency and fidelity in high-dimensional image generation, which is highly relevant to your interests in generative modeling and clever statistical tricks.

## 8. [Spanning the Visual Analogy Space with a Weight Basis of LoRAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15727) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15727
**Authors:** Hila Manor, Rinon Gal, Haggai Maron, Tomer Michaeli, Gal Chechik

**Abstract:**  Visual analogy learning enables image manipulation through demonstration rather than textual description, allowing users to specify complex transformations difficult to articulate in words. Given a triplet $\{\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{a}'$, $\mathbf{b}\}$, the goal is to generate $\mathbf{b}'$ such that $\mathbf{a} : \mathbf{a}' :: \mathbf{b} : \mathbf{b}'$. Recent methods adapt text-to-image models to this task using a single Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module, but they face a fundamental limitation: attempting to capture the diverse space of visual transformations within a fixed adaptation module constrains generalization capabilities. Inspired by recent work showing that LoRAs in constrained domains span meaningful, interpolatable semantic spaces, we propose LoRWeB, a novel approach that specializes the model for each analogy task at inference time through dynamic composition of learned transformation primitives, informally, choosing a point in a "space of LoRAs". We introduce two key components: (1) a learnable basis of LoRA modules, to span the space of different visual transformations, and (2) a lightweight encoder that dynamically selects and weighs these basis LoRAs based on the input analogy pair. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improves generalization to unseen visual transformations. Our findings suggest that LoRA basis decompositions are a promising direction for flexible visual manipulation. Code and data are in https://research.nvidia.com/labs/par/lorweb

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) and generative modeling in multi-modal learning. Proposes LoRWeB, a new method for visual analogy learning using a basis of LoRA modules for flexible image manipulation, achieving SOTA and improved generalization.

## 9. [Sparrow: Text-Anchored Window Attention with Visual-Semantic Glimpsing for Speculative Decoding in Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15318) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15318
**Authors:** Libo Zhang, Zhaoning Zhang, Wangyang Hong, Peng Qiao, Dongsheng Li

**Abstract:**  Although speculative decoding is widely used to accelerate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) inference, it faces severe performance collapse when applied to Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs). The draft model typically falls into the trap of attention dilution and negative visual gain due to key-value cache explosion and context window mismatches. We observe a visual semantic internalization phenomenon in Vid-LLMs, indicating that critical visual semantics are implicitly encoded into text hidden states during deep-layer interactions, which renders raw visual inputs structurally redundant during deep inference. To address this, we propose the Sparrow framework, which first utilizes visually-aware text-anchored window attention via hidden state reuse to fully offload visual computation to the target model, and leverages intermediate-layer visual state bridging to train the draft model with semantic-rich intermediate states, thereby filtering out low-level visual noise. Additionally, a multi-token prediction strategy is introduced to bridge the training-inference distribution shift. Experiments show that Sparrow achieves an average speedup of 2.82x even with 25k visual tokens, effectively resolving the performance degradation in long sequences and offering a practical solution for real-time long video tasks.

**Comment:** This paper introduces Sparrow, a framework for speculative decoding in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs), addressing attention dilution and visual semantic internalization. It matches criterion 2 (new VLLMs/MLLMs) and is highly relevant for vision-language models and their efficient inference.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15294
**Authors:** Ming Du, Yanqi Luo, Srutarshi Banerjee, Michael Wojcik, Jelena Popovic, Mathew J. Cherukara

**Abstract:**  We present Experiment Automation Agents (EAA), a vision-language-model-driven agentic system designed to automate complex experimental microscopy workflows. EAA integrates multimodal reasoning, tool-augmented action, and optional long-term memory to support both autonomous procedures and interactive user-guided measurements. Built on a flexible task-manager architecture, the system enables workflows ranging from fully agent-driven automation to logic-defined routines that embed localized LLM queries. EAA further provides a modern tool ecosystem with two-way compatibility for Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing instrument-control tools to be consumed or served across applications. We demonstrate EAA at an imaging beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, including automated zone plate focusing, natural language-described feature search, and interactive data acquisition. These results illustrate how vision-capable agents can enhance beamline efficiency, reduce operational burden, and lower the expertise barrier for users.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new VLLMs/MLLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Presents an agentic system using vision-language models to automate experimental microscopy workflows, demonstrating real-world applications of VLM agents.

## 11. [Understanding vs. Generation: Navigating Optimization Dilemma in Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15772) <a id="link11"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15772
**Authors:** Sen Ye, Mengde Xu, Shuyang Gu, Di He, Liwei Wang, Han Hu

**Abstract:**  Current research in multimodal models faces a key challenge where enhancing generative capabilities often comes at the expense of understanding, and vice versa. We analyzed this trade-off and identify the primary cause might be the potential conflict between generation and understanding, which creates a competitive dynamic within the model. To address this, we propose the Reason-Reflect-Refine (R3) framework. This innovative algorithm re-frames the single-step generation task into a multi-step process of "generate-understand-regenerate". By explicitly leveraging the model's understanding capability during generation, we successfully mitigate the optimization dilemma, achieved stronger generation results and improved understanding ability which are related to the generation process. This offers valuable insights for designing next-generation unified multimodal models. Code is available at https://github.com/sen-ye/R3.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new MLLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Proposes the R3 framework to address the trade-off between understanding and generation in multimodal models, offering a new multi-step optimization process.

## 12. [When Remembering and Planning are Worth it: Navigating under Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15274) <a id="link12"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15274
**Authors:** Omid Madani, J. Brian Burns, Reza Eghbali, Thomas L. Dean

**Abstract:**  We explore how different types and uses of memory can aid spatial navigation in changing uncertain environments. In the simple foraging task we study, every day, our agent has to find its way from its home, through barriers, to food. Moreover, the world is non-stationary: from day to day, the location of the barriers and food may change, and the agent's sensing such as its location information is uncertain and very limited. Any model construction, such as a map, and use, such as planning, needs to be robust against these challenges, and if any learning is to be useful, it needs to be adequately fast. We look at a range of strategies, from simple to sophisticated, with various uses of memory and learning. We find that an architecture that can incorporate multiple strategies is required to handle (sub)tasks of a different nature, in particular for exploration and search, when food location is not known, and for planning a good path to a remembered (likely) food location. An agent that utilizes non-stationary probability learning techniques to keep updating its (episodic) memories and that uses those memories to build maps and plan on the fly (imperfect maps, i.e. noisy and limited to the agent's experience) can be increasingly and substantially more efficient than the simpler (minimal-memory) agents, as the task difficulties such as distance to goal are raised, as long as the uncertainty, from localization and change, is not too large.

**Comment:** This paper explores memory and planning strategies for spatial navigation in changing, uncertain environments, analyzing architectures that combine episodic memory, map-building, and planning. It matches criterion 1 (spatial understanding on embodied agents) and criterion 3 (embodied AI, new methods for navigation), with a focus on memory and learning strategies in non-stationary settings.

## 13. [ResearchGym: Evaluating Language Model Agents on Real-World AI Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15112) <a id="link13"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15112
**Authors:** Aniketh Garikaparthi, Manasi Patwardhan, Arman Cohan

**Abstract:**  We introduce ResearchGym, a benchmark and execution environment for evaluating AI agents on end-to-end research. To instantiate this, we repurpose five oral and spotlight papers from ICML, ICLR, and ACL. From each paper's repository, we preserve the datasets, evaluation harness, and baseline implementations but withhold the paper's proposed method. This results in five containerized task environments comprising 39 sub-tasks in total. Within each environment, agents must propose novel hypotheses, run experiments, and attempt to surpass strong human baselines on the paper's metrics. In a controlled evaluation of an agent powered by GPT-5, we observe a sharp capability--reliability gap. The agent improves over the provided baselines from the repository in just 1 of 15 evaluations (6.7%) by 11.5%, and completes only 26.5% of sub-tasks on average. We identify recurring long-horizon failure modes, including impatience, poor time and resource management, overconfidence in weak hypotheses, difficulty coordinating parallel experiments, and hard limits from context length. Yet in a single run, the agent surpasses the solution of an ICML 2025 Spotlight task, indicating that frontier agents can occasionally reach state-of-the-art performance, but do so unreliably. We additionally evaluate proprietary agent scaffolds including Claude Code (Opus-4.5) and Codex (GPT-5.2) which display a similar gap. ResearchGym provides infrastructure for systematic evaluation and analysis of autonomous agents on closed-loop research.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (embodied AI, new benchmark/simulator) by introducing ResearchGym, a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on end-to-end research tasks, with a focus on agentic capabilities and failure modes.

**Abstract:**  Radiology Report Generation (RRG) through Vision-Language Models (VLMs) promises to reduce documentation burden, improve reporting consistency, and accelerate clinical workflows. However, their clinical adoption remains limited by the lack of interpretability and the tendency to hallucinate findings misaligned with imaging evidence. Existing research typically treats interpretability and accuracy as separate objectives, with concept-based explainability techniques focusing primarily on transparency, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods targeting factual grounding through external retrieval. We present Concept-Enhanced Multimodal RAG (CEMRAG), a unified framework that decomposes visual representations into interpretable clinical concepts and integrates them with multimodal RAG. This approach exploits enriched contextual prompts for RRG, improving both interpretability and factual accuracy. Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray across multiple VLM architectures, training regimes, and retrieval configurations demonstrate consistent improvements over both conventional RAG and concept-only baselines on clinical accuracy metrics and standard NLP measures. These results challenge the assumed trade-off between interpretability and performance, showing that transparent visual concepts can enhance rather than compromise diagnostic accuracy in medical VLMs. Our modular design decomposes interpretability into visual transparency and structured language model conditioning, providing a principled pathway toward clinically trustworthy AI-assisted radiology.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (VLLMs/MLLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) by proposing a concept-enhanced multimodal RAG for interpretable and accurate radiology report generation using VLMs.

## 15. [GlobeDiff: State Diffusion Process for Partial Observability in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15776) <a id="link15"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15776
**Authors:** Yiqin Yang, Xu Yang, Yuhua Jiang, Ni Mu, Hao Hu, Runpeng Xie, Ziyou Zhang, Siyuan Li, Yuan-Hua Ni, Qianchuan Zhao, Bo Xu

**Abstract:**  In the realm of multi-agent systems, the challenge of \emph{partial observability} is a critical barrier to effective coordination and decision-making. Existing approaches, such as belief state estimation and inter-agent communication, often fall short. Belief-based methods are limited by their focus on past experiences without fully leveraging global information, while communication methods often lack a robust model to effectively utilize the auxiliary information they provide. To solve this issue, we propose Global State Diffusion Algorithm~(GlobeDiff) to infer the global state based on the local observations. By formulating the state inference process as a multi-modal diffusion process, GlobeDiff overcomes ambiguities in state estimation while simultaneously inferring the global state with high fidelity. We prove that the estimation error of GlobeDiff under both unimodal and multi-modal distributions can be bounded. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GlobeDiff achieves superior performance and is capable of accurately inferring the global state.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (new methodological improvements to spatial understanding in multi-agent systems) via a novel diffusion-based approach for global state inference under partial observability.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15355
**Authors:** Rong Fu, Jiekai Wu, Haiyun Wei, Yee Tan Jia, Wenxin Zhang, Yang Li, Xiaowen Ma, Wangyu Wu, Simon Fong

**Abstract:**  The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has fundamentally redefined the capabilities of photorealistic neural rendering by enabling high-throughput synthesis of complex environments. While procedural methods like Wang Tiles have recently been integrated to facilitate the generation of expansive landscapes, these systems typically remain constrained by a reliance on densely sampled exemplar reconstructions. We present DAV-GSWT, a data-efficient framework that leverages diffusion priors and active view sampling to synthesize high-fidelity Gaussian Splatting Wang Tiles from minimal input observations. By integrating a hierarchical uncertainty quantification mechanism with generative diffusion models, our approach autonomously identifies the most informative viewpoints while hallucinating missing structural details to ensure seamless tile transitions. Experimental results indicate that our system significantly reduces the required data volume while maintaining the visual integrity and interactive performance necessary for large-scale virtual environments.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) and partially criterion 3 (embodied AI benchmarks/methods with novel angles), as it proposes a data-efficient framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting using diffusion models and active view sampling, which is a novel approach for large-scale virtual environments. The integration of uncertainty quantification and generative diffusion models for efficient scene synthesis is a clever methodological improvement.

## 17. [CARE Drive A Framework for Evaluating Reason-Responsiveness of Vision Language Models in Automated Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15645) <a id="link17"></a>

**Authors:** Lucas Elbert Suryana, Farah Bierenga, Sanne van Buuren, Pepijn Kooij, Elsefien Tulleners, Federico Scari, Simeon Calvert, Bart van Arem, Arkady Zgonnikov

**Abstract:**  Foundation models, including vision language models, are increasingly used in automated driving to interpret scenes, recommend actions, and generate natural language explanations. However, existing evaluation methods primarily assess outcome based performance, such as safety and trajectory accuracy, without determining whether model decisions reflect human relevant considerations. As a result, it remains unclear whether explanations produced by such models correspond to genuine reason responsive decision making or merely post hoc rationalizations. This limitation is especially significant in safety critical domains because it can create false confidence. To address this gap, we propose CARE Drive, Context Aware Reasons Evaluation for Driving, a model agnostic framework for evaluating reason responsiveness in vision language models applied to automated driving. CARE Drive compares baseline and reason augmented model decisions under controlled contextual variation to assess whether human reasons causally influence decision behavior. The framework employs a two stage evaluation process. Prompt calibration ensures stable outputs. Systematic contextual perturbation then measures decision sensitivity to human reasons such as safety margins, social pressure, and efficiency constraints. We demonstrate CARE Drive in a cyclist overtaking scenario involving competing normative considerations. Results show that explicit human reasons significantly influence model decisions, improving alignment with expert recommended behavior. However, responsiveness varies across contextual factors, indicating uneven sensitivity to different types of reasons. These findings provide empirical evidence that reason responsiveness in foundation models can be systematically evaluated without modifying model parameters.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Introduces CARE Drive, a framework for evaluating reason-responsiveness in vision-language models for automated driving, providing a new evaluation angle for VLMs in safety-critical applications.

## 18. [RPT-SR: Regional Prior attention Transformer for infrared image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15490) <a id="link18"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15490
**Authors:** Youngwan Jin, Incheol Park, Yagiz Nalcakan, Hyeongjin Ju, Sanghyeop Yeo, Shiho Kim

**Abstract:**  General-purpose super-resolution models, particularly Vision Transformers, have achieved remarkable success but exhibit fundamental inefficiencies in common infrared imaging scenarios like surveillance and autonomous driving, which operate from fixed or nearly-static viewpoints. These models fail to exploit the strong, persistent spatial priors inherent in such scenes, leading to redundant learning and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Regional Prior attention Transformer for infrared image Super-Resolution (RPT-SR), a novel architecture that explicitly encodes scene layout information into the attention mechanism. Our core contribution is a dual-token framework that fuses (1) learnable, regional prior tokens, which act as a persistent memory for the scene's global structure, with (2) local tokens that capture the frame-specific content of the current input. By utilizing these tokens into an attention, our model allows the priors to dynamically modulate the local reconstruction process. Extensive experiments validate our approach. While most prior works focus on a single infrared band, we demonstrate the broad applicability and versatility of RPT-SR by establishing new state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets covering both Long-Wave (LWIR) and Short-Wave (SWIR) spectra

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (spatial understanding on embodied agents) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Proposes a transformer architecture that encodes regional spatial priors for infrared image super-resolution, improving performance in fixed-viewpoint scenarios.

## 19. [Time-Archival Camera Virtualization for Sports and Visual Performances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15181) <a id="link19"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15181
**Authors:** Yunxiao Zhang, William Stone, Suryansh Kumar

**Abstract:**  Camera virtualization -- an emerging solution to novel view synthesis -- holds transformative potential for visual entertainment, live performances, and sports broadcasting by enabling the generation of photorealistic images from novel viewpoints using images from a limited set of calibrated multiple static physical cameras. Despite recent advances, achieving spatially and temporally coherent and photorealistic rendering of dynamic scenes with efficient time-archival capabilities, particularly in fast-paced sports and stage performances, remains challenging for existing approaches. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for dynamic scenes could offer real-time view-synthesis results. Yet, they are hindered by their dependence on accurate 3D point clouds from the structure-from-motion method and their inability to handle large, non-rigid, rapid motions of different subjects (e.g., flips, jumps, articulations, sudden player-to-player transitions). Moreover, independent motions of multiple subjects can break the Gaussian-tracking assumptions commonly used in 4DGS, ST-GS, and other dynamic splatting variants. This paper advocates reconsidering a neural volume rendering formulation for camera virtualization and efficient time-archival capabilities, making it useful for sports broadcasting and related applications. By modeling a dynamic scene as rigid transformations across multiple synchronized camera views at a given time, our method performs neural representation learning, providing enhanced visual rendering quality at test time. A key contribution of our approach is its support for time-archival, i.e., users can revisit any past temporal instance of a dynamic scene and can perform novel view synthesis, enabling retrospective rendering for replay, analysis, and archival of live events, a functionality absent in existing neural rendering approaches and novel view synthesis...

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) and partially criterion 1 (spatial understanding in dynamic scenes for camera virtualization). The paper proposes a new neural volume rendering approach for time-archival camera virtualization, enabling retrospective novel view synthesis in dynamic sports and performance scenes.

## 20. [Bridging Day and Night: Target-Class Hallucination Suppression in Unpaired Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15383) <a id="link20"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15383
**Authors:** Shuwei Li, Lei Tan, Robby T. Tan

**Abstract:**  Day-to-night unpaired image translation is important to downstream tasks but remains challenging due to large appearance shifts and the lack of direct pixel-level supervision. Existing methods often introduce semantic hallucinations, where objects from target classes such as traffic signs and vehicles, as well as man-made light effects, are incorrectly synthesized. These hallucinations significantly degrade downstream performance. We propose a novel framework that detects and suppresses hallucinations of target-class features during unpaired translation. To detect hallucination, we design a dual-head discriminator that additionally performs semantic segmentation to identify hallucinated content in background regions. To suppress these hallucinations, we introduce class-specific prototypes, constructed by aggregating features of annotated target-domain objects, which act as semantic anchors for each class. Built upon a Schrodinger Bridge-based translation model, our framework performs iterative refinement, where detected hallucination features are explicitly pushed away from class prototypes in feature space, thus preserving object semantics across the translation trajectory.Experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. On the BDD100K dataset, it improves mAP by 15.5% for day-to-night domain adaptation, with a notable 31.7% gain for classes such as traffic lights that are prone to hallucinations.

## 21. [ToaSt: Token Channel Selection and Structured Pruning for Efficient ViT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15720) <a id="link21"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15720
**Authors:** Hyunchan Moon, Cheonjun Park, Steven L. Waslander

**Abstract:**  Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success across various vision tasks, yet their deployment is often hindered by prohibitive computational costs. While structured weight pruning and token compression have emerged as promising solutions, they suffer from prolonged retraining times and global propagation that creates optimization challenges, respectively. We propose ToaSt, a decoupled framework applying specialized strategies to distinct ViT components. We apply coupled head-wise structured pruning to Multi-Head Self-Attention modules, leveraging attention operation characteristics to enhance robustness. For Feed-Forward Networks (over 60\% of FLOPs), we introduce Token Channel Selection (TCS) that enhances compression ratios while avoiding global propagation issues. Our analysis reveals TCS effectively filters redundant noise during selection. Extensive evaluations across nine diverse models, including DeiT, ViT-MAE, and Swin Transformer, demonstrate that ToaSt achieves superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, consistently outperforming existing baselines. On ViT-MAE-Huge, ToaSt achieves 88.52\% accuracy (+1.64 \%) with 39.4\% FLOPs reduction. ToaSt transfers effectively to downstream tasks, cccccachieving 52.2 versus 51.9 mAP on COCO object detection. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

**Comment:** This paper presents ToaSt, a new method for efficient Vision Transformers (ViTs) via token channel selection and structured pruning. It is relevant to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications), as it proposes a novel compression/pruning method for ViTs, a core vision foundation model.

## 22. [An Industrial Dataset for Scene Acquisitions and Functional Schematics Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15584) <a id="link22"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15584
**Authors:** Flavien Armangeon, Thibaud Ehret, Enric Meinhardt-Llopis, Rafael Grompone von Gioi, Guillaume Thibault, Marc Petit, Gabriele Facciolo

**Abstract:**  Aligning functional schematics with 2D and 3D scene acquisitions is crucial for building digital twins, especially for old industrial facilities that lack native digital models. Current manual alignment using images and LiDAR data does not scale due to tediousness and complexity of industrial sites. Inconsistencies between schematics and reality, and the scarcity of public industrial datasets, make the problem both challenging and underexplored. This paper introduces IRIS-v2, a comprehensive dataset to support further research. It includes images, point clouds, 2D annotated boxes and segmentation masks, a CAD model, 3D pipe routing information, and the P&ID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagram). The alignment is experimented on a practical case study, aiming at reducing the time required for this task by combining segmentation and graph matching.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) by providing a new industrial dataset for scene and schematic alignment, which is important for digital twins and spatial understanding.

## 23. [Dynamic Training-Free Fusion of Subject and Style LoRAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15539) <a id="link23"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15539
**Authors:** Qinglong Cao, Yuntian Chen, Chao Ma, Xiaokang Yang

**Abstract:**  Recent studies have explored the combination of multiple LoRAs to simultaneously generate user-specified subjects and styles. However, most existing approaches fuse LoRA weights using static statistical heuristics that deviate from LoRA's original purpose of learning adaptive feature adjustments and ignore the randomness of sampled inputs. To address this, we propose a dynamic training-free fusion framework that operates throughout the generation process. During the forward pass, at each LoRA-applied layer, we dynamically compute the KL divergence between the base model's original features and those produced by subject and style LoRAs, respectively, and adaptively select the most appropriate weights for fusion. In the reverse denoising stage, we further refine the generation trajectory by dynamically applying gradient-based corrections derived from objective metrics such as CLIP and DINO scores, providing continuous semantic and stylistic guidance. By integrating these two complementary mechanisms-feature-level selection and metric-guided latent adjustment-across the entire diffusion timeline, our method dynamically achieves coherent subject-style synthesis without any retraining. Extensive experiments across diverse subject-style combinations demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LoRA fusion methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a dynamic, training-free fusion framework for combining subject and style LoRAs in diffusion models, using KL divergence and metric-guided latent adjustment. It introduces a clever statistical trick for adaptive fusion, but does not directly address spatial intelligence, embodied agents, VLLMs/MLLMs, or vision foundation models. Closest to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) due to LoRA and diffusion model focus.

## 24. [PERSONA: Dynamic and Compositional Inference-Time Personality Control via Activation Vector Algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15669) <a id="link24"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15669
**Authors:** Xiachong Feng, Liang Zhao, Weihong Zhong, Yichong Huang, Yuxuan Gu, Lingpeng Kong, Xiaocheng Feng, Bing Qin

**Abstract:**  Current methods for personality control in Large Language Models rely on static prompting or expensive fine-tuning, failing to capture the dynamic and compositional nature of human traits. We introduce PERSONA, a training-free framework that achieves fine-tuning level performance through direct manipulation of personality vectors in activation space. Our key insight is that personality traits appear as extractable, approximately orthogonal directions in the model's representation space that support algebraic operations. The framework operates through three stages: Persona-Base extracts orthogonal trait vectors via contrastive activation analysis; Persona-Algebra enables precise control through vector arithmetic (scalar multiplication for intensity, addition for composition, subtraction for suppression); and Persona-Flow achieves context-aware adaptation by dynamically composing these vectors during inference. On PersonalityBench, our approach achieves a mean score of 9.60, nearly matching the supervised fine-tuning upper bound of 9.61 without any gradient updates. On our proposed Persona-Evolve benchmark for dynamic personality adaptation, we achieve up to 91% win rates across diverse model families. These results provide evidence that aspects of LLM personality are mathematically tractable, opening new directions for interpretable and efficient behavioral control.

**Comment:** This paper introduces PERSONA, a training-free framework for dynamic and compositional personality control in LLMs via activation vector algebra. While it is a novel method for LLM control, it does not address spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15173
**Authors:** Luise Ge, Yongyan Zhang, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik

**Abstract:**  The use of large language models either as decision support systems, or in agentic workflows, is rapidly transforming the digital ecosystem. However, the understanding of LLM decision-making under uncertainty remains limited. We initiate a comparative study of LLM risky choices along two dimensions: (1) prospect representation (explicit vs. experience based) and (2) decision rationale (explanation). Our study, which involves 20 frontier and open LLMs, is complemented by a matched human subjects experiment, which provides one reference point, while an expected payoff maximizing rational agent model provides another. We find that LLMs cluster into two categories: reasoning models (RMs) and conversational models (CMs). RMs tend towards rational behavior, are insensitive to the order of prospects, gain/loss framing, and explanations, and behave similarly whether prospects are explicit or presented via experience history. CMs are significantly less rational, slightly more human-like, sensitive to prospect ordering, framing, and explanation, and exhibit a large description-history gap. Paired comparisons of open LLMs suggest that a key factor differentiating RMs and CMs is training for mathematical reasoning.

**Comment:** Does not directly match any of the four criteria. The paper is about LLMs' decision-making under uncertainty, focusing on reasoning vs. conversational models, but does not address spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15156
**Authors:** Shreyas Rajesh, Pavan Holur, Mehmet Yigit Turali, Chenda Duan, Vwani Roychowdhury

**Abstract:**  Language models are increasingly used to reason over content they were not trained on, such as new documents, evolving knowledge, and user-specific data. A common approach is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which stores verbatim documents externally (as chunks) and retrieves only a relevant subset at inference time for an LLM to reason over. However, this results in inefficient usage of test-time compute (LLM repeatedly reasons over the same documents); moreover, chunk retrieval can inject irrelevant context that increases unsupported generation. We propose a human-like non-parametric continual learning framework, where the base model remains fixed, and learning occurs by integrating each new experience into an external semantic memory state that accumulates and consolidates itself continually. We present Panini, which realizes this by representing documents as Generative Semantic Workspaces (GSW) -- an entity- and event-aware network of question-answer (QA) pairs, sufficient for an LLM to reconstruct the experienced situations and mine latent knowledge via reasoning-grounded inference chains on the network. Given a query, Panini only traverses the continually-updated GSW (not the verbatim documents or chunks), and retrieves the most likely inference chains. Across six QA benchmarks, Panini achieves the highest average performance, 5%-7% higher than other competitive baselines, while using 2-30x fewer answer-context tokens, supports fully open-source pipelines, and reduces unsupported answers on curated unanswerable queries. The results show that efficient and accurate structuring of experiences at write time -- as achieved by the GSW framework -- yields both efficiency and reliability gains at read time. Code is available at https://github.com/roychowdhuryresearch/gsw-memory.

**Comment:** Does not directly match any specific criterion, but is relevant to continual learning and memory in LLMs. No direct spatial, vision, or embodied AI focus.

## 28. [Enhancing Diversity and Feasibility: Joint Population Synthesis from Multi-source Data Using Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15270) <a id="link28"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15270
**Authors:** Farbod Abbasi, Zachary Patterson, Bilal Farooq

**Abstract:**  Generating realistic synthetic populations is essential for agent-based models (ABM) in transportation and urban planning. Current methods face two major limitations. First, many rely on a single dataset or follow a sequential data fusion and generation process, which means they fail to capture the complex interplay between features. Second, these approaches struggle with sampling zeros (valid but unobserved attribute combinations) and structural zeros (infeasible combinations due to logical constraints), which reduce the diversity and feasibility of the generated data. This study proposes a novel method to simultaneously integrate and synthesize multi-source datasets using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with gradient penalty. This joint learning method improves both the diversity and feasibility of synthetic data by defining a regularization term (inverse gradient penalty) for the generator loss function. For the evaluation, we implement a unified evaluation metric for similarity, and place special emphasis on measuring diversity and feasibility through recall, precision, and the F1 score. Results show that the proposed joint approach outperforms the sequential baseline, with recall increasing by 7\% and precision by 15\%. Additionally, the regularization term further improves diversity and feasibility, reflected in a 10\% increase in recall and 1\% in precision. We assess similarity distributions using a five-metric score. The joint approach performs better overall, and reaches a score of 88.1 compared to 84.6 for the sequential method. Since synthetic populations serve as a key input for ABM, this multi-source generative approach has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of ABM.

**Comment:** Does not match any specific criterion. Focuses on synthetic population generation for agent-based models using generative models, but not in a vision or embodied AI context.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15811
**Authors:** Muthu Subash Kavitha, Anas Zafar, Amgad Muneer, Jia Wu

**Abstract:**  Clinical deployment of chest radiograph classifiers requires models that can be updated as new datasets become available without retraining on previously ob- served data or degrading validated performance. We study, for the first time, a task-incremental continual learning setting for chest radiograph classification, in which heterogeneous chest X-ray datasets arrive sequentially and task identifiers are unavailable at inference. We propose a continual adapter-based routing learning strategy for Chest X-rays (CARL-XRay) that maintains a fixed high-capacity backbone and incrementally allocates lightweight task-specific adapters and classifier heads. A latent task selector operates on task-adapted features and leverages both current and historical context preserved through compact prototypes and feature-level experience replay. This design supports stable task identification and adaptation across sequential updates while avoiding raw-image storage. Experiments on large-scale public chest radiograph datasets demonstrate robust performance retention and reliable task-aware inference under continual dataset ingestion. CARL-XRay outperforms joint training under task-unknown deployment, achieving higher routing accuracy (75.0\% vs.\ 62.5\%), while maintaining competitive diagnostic performance with AUROC of 0.74 in the oracle setting with ground-truth task identity and 0.75 under task-unknown inference, using significantly fewer trainable parameters. Finally, the proposed framework provides a practical alternative to joint training and repeated full retraining in continual clinical deployment.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a continual learning framework for chest radiograph classification, focusing on adapter-based routing and task-agnostic inference. While it is in the general area of computer vision and machine learning, it does not address spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15349
**Authors:** Jinho Baek, Houwei Cao, Kate Blackwell

**Abstract:**  Dog emotion recognition plays a crucial role in enhancing human-animal interactions, veterinary care, and the development of automated systems for monitoring canine well-being. However, accurately interpreting dog emotions is challenging due to the subjective nature of emotional assessments and the absence of standardized ground truth methods. We present the CREMD (Crowd-sourced Emotional Multimodal Dogs Dataset), a comprehensive dataset exploring how different presentation modes (e.g., context, audio, video) and annotator characteristics (e.g., dog ownership, gender, professional experience) influence the perception and labeling of dog emotions. The dataset consists of 923 video clips presented in three distinct modes: without context or audio, with context but no audio, and with both context and audio. We analyze annotations from diverse participants, including dog owners, professionals, and individuals with varying demographic backgrounds and experience levels, to identify factors that influence reliable dog emotion recognition. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) while adding visual context significantly improved annotation agreement, our findings regarding audio cues are inconclusive due to design limitations (specifically, the absence of a no-context-with-audio condition and limited clean audio availability); (2) contrary to expectations, non-owners and male annotators showed higher agreement levels than dog owners and female annotators, respectively, while professionals showed higher agreement levels, aligned with our initial hypothesis; and (3) the presence of audio substantially increased annotators' confidence in identifying specific emotions, particularly anger and fear.

**Comment:** Does not match any specific criterion. Presents a multimodal dataset for dog emotion recognition, which is interesting but not directly related to spatial intelligence, VLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.
