## 0. [SayNext-Bench: Why Do LLMs Struggle with Next-Utterance Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00327) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.00327
**Authors:** Yueyi Yang, Haotian Liu, Fang Kang, Mengqi Zhang, Zheng Lian, Hao Tang, Haoyu Chen

**Abstract:**  We explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for next-utterance prediction in human dialogue. Despite recent advances in LLMs demonstrating their ability to engage in natural conversations with users, we show that even leading models surprisingly struggle to predict a human speaker's next utterance. Instead, humans can readily anticipate forthcoming utterances based on multimodal cues, such as gestures, gaze, and emotional tone, from the context. To systematically examine whether LLMs can reproduce this ability, we propose SayNext-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on anticipating context-conditioned responses from multimodal cues spanning a variety of real-world scenarios. To support this benchmark, we build SayNext-PC, a novel large-scale dataset containing dialogues with rich multimodal cues. Building on this, we further develop a dual-route prediction MLLM, SayNext-Chat, that incorporates cognitively inspired design to emulate predictive processing in conversation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs in terms of lexical overlap, semantic similarity, and emotion consistency. Our results prove the feasibility of next-utterance prediction with LLMs from multimodal cues and emphasize the (i) indispensable role of multimodal cues and (ii) actively predictive processing as the foundation of natural human interaction, which is missing in current MLLMs. We hope that this exploration offers a new research entry toward more human-like, context-sensitive AI interaction for human-centered AI. Our benchmark and model can be accessed at https://saynext.github.io/.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new MLLMs) and criterion 3 (new benchmark for embodied AI with a novel angle). Introduces SayNext-Bench, a new benchmark and dataset for next-utterance prediction using multimodal cues, and proposes a new MLLM (SayNext-Chat) with cognitively inspired design. This is a strong fit for your friend's interests in multi-modal learning, benchmarks, and surprising empirical results.

## 1. [IVC-Prune: Revealing the Implicit Visual Coordinates in LVLMs for Vision Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03060) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03060
**Authors:** Zhichao Sun, Yidong Ma, Gang Liu, Yibo Chen, Xu Tang, Yao Hu, Yongchao Xu

**Abstract:**  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve impressive performance across multiple tasks. A significant challenge, however, is their prohibitive inference cost when processing high-resolution visual inputs. While visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods that primarily focus on semantic relevance often discard tokens that are crucial for spatial reasoning. We address this gap through a novel insight into \emph{how LVLMs process spatial reasoning}. Specifically, we reveal that LVLMs implicitly establish visual coordinate systems through Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), where specific token positions serve as \textbf{implicit visual coordinates} (IVC tokens) that are essential for spatial reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{IVC-Prune}, a training-free, prompt-aware pruning strategy that retains both IVC tokens and semantically relevant foreground tokens. IVC tokens are identified by theoretically analyzing the mathematical properties of RoPE, targeting positions at which its rotation matrices approximate identity matrix or the $90^\circ$ rotation matrix. Foreground tokens are identified through a robust two-stage process: semantic seed discovery followed by contextual refinement via value-vector similarity. Extensive evaluations across four representative LVLMs and twenty diverse benchmarks show that IVC-Prune reduces visual tokens by approximately 50\% while maintaining $\geq$ 99\% of the original performance and even achieving improvements on several benchmarks. Source codes are available at https://github.com/FireRedTeam/IVC-Prune.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 and 4: Proposes IVC-Prune, a new token pruning method for LVLMs that preserves implicit visual coordinates for spatial reasoning. Highly relevant to vision-language models and spatial intelligence.

## 2. [N\"uwa: Mending the Spatial Integrity Torn by VLM Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02951) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.02951
**Authors:** Yihong Huang, Fei Ma, Yihua Shao, Jingcai Guo, Zitong Yu, Laizhong Cui, Qi Tian

**Abstract:**  Vision token pruning has proven to be an effective acceleration technique for the efficient Vision Language Model (VLM). However, existing pruning methods demonstrate excellent performance preservation in visual question answering (VQA) and suffer substantial degradation on visual grounding (VG) tasks. Our analysis of the VLM's processing pipeline reveals that strategies utilizing global semantic similarity and attention scores lose the global spatial reference frame, which is derived from the interactions of tokens' positional information. Motivated by these findings, we propose $\text{N\"uwa}$, a two-stage token pruning framework that enables efficient feature aggregation while maintaining spatial integrity. In the first stage, after the vision encoder, we apply three operations, namely separation, alignment, and aggregation, which are inspired by swarm intelligence algorithms to retain information-rich global spatial anchors. In the second stage, within the LLM, we perform text-guided pruning to retain task-relevant visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\text{N\"uwa}$ achieves SOTA performance on multiple VQA benchmarks (from 94% to 95%) and yields substantial improvements on visual grounding tasks (from 7% to 47%).

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 and 4: Proposes a new VLM token pruning method (Nüwa) that preserves spatial integrity, with strong results on VQA and visual grounding. Directly relevant to vision-language models and their spatial reasoning.

## 3. [EventFlash: Towards Efficient MLLMs for Event-Based Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03230) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03230
**Authors:** Shaoyu Liu, Jianing Li, Guanghui Zhao, Yunjian Zhang, Wen Jiang, Ming Li, Xiangyang Ji

**Abstract:**  Event-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable robust perception in high-speed and low-light scenarios, addressing key limitations of frame-based MLLMs. However, current event-based MLLMs often rely on dense image-like processing paradigms, overlooking the spatiotemporal sparsity of event streams and resulting in high computational cost. In this paper, we propose EventFlash, a novel and efficient MLLM to explore spatiotemporal token sparsification for reducing data redundancy and accelerating inference. Technically, we build EventMind, a large-scale and scene-diverse dataset with over 500k instruction sets, providing both short and long event stream sequences to support our curriculum training strategy. We then present an adaptive temporal window aggregation module for efficient temporal sampling, which adaptively compresses temporal tokens while retaining key temporal cues. Finally, a sparse density-guided attention module is designed to improve spatial token efficiency by selecting informative regions and suppressing empty or sparse areas. Experimental results show that EventFlash achieves a $12.4\times$ throughput improvement over the baseline (EventFlash-Zero) while maintaining comparable performance. It supports long-range event stream processing with up to 1,000 bins, significantly outperforming the 5-bin limit of EventGPT. We believe EventFlash serves as an efficient foundation model for event-based vision.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new MLLMs, specifically for event-based vision) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). EventFlash introduces a novel, efficient MLLM for event-based vision, with new dataset and spatiotemporal token sparsification.

## 4. [Spiral RoPE: Rotate Your Rotary Positional Embeddings in the 2D Plane](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03227) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03227
**Authors:** Haoyu Liu, Sucheng Ren, Tingyu Zhu, Peng Wang, Cihang Xie, Alan Yuille, Zeyu Zheng, Feng Wang

**Abstract:**  Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is the de facto positional encoding in large language models due to its ability to encode relative positions and support length extrapolation. When adapted to vision transformers, the standard axial formulation decomposes two-dimensional spatial positions into horizontal and vertical components, implicitly restricting positional encoding to axis-aligned directions. We identify this directional constraint as a fundamental limitation of the standard axial 2D RoPE, which hinders the modeling of oblique spatial relationships that naturally exist in natural images. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spiral RoPE, a simple yet effective extension that enables multi-directional positional encoding by partitioning embedding channels into multiple groups associated with uniformly distributed directions. Each group is rotated according to the projection of the patch position onto its corresponding direction, allowing spatial relationships to be encoded beyond the horizontal and vertical axes. Across a wide range of vision tasks including classification, segmentation, and generation, Spiral RoPE consistently improves performance. Qualitative analysis of attention maps further show that Spiral RoPE exhibits more concentrated activations on semantically relevant objects and better respects local object boundaries, highlighting the importance of multi-directional positional encoding in vision transformers.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (new methodological improvements to spatial understanding in vision transformers, specifically multi-directional positional encoding) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Spiral RoPE addresses a fundamental limitation in 2D RoPE for vision transformers, improving spatial intelligence.

## 5. [SlowFocus: Enhancing Fine-grained Temporal Understanding in Video LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03589) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03589
**Authors:** Ming Nie, Dan Ding, Chunwei Wang, Yuanfan Guo, Jianhua Han, Hang Xu, Li Zhang

**Abstract:**  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in text understanding, which has paved the way for their expansion into video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to analyze video data. However, current Vid-LLMs struggle to simultaneously retain high-quality frame-level semantic information (i.e., a sufficient number of tokens per frame) and comprehensive video-level temporal information (i.e., an adequate number of sampled frames per video). This limitation hinders the advancement of Vid-LLMs towards fine-grained video understanding. To address this issue, we introduce the SlowFocus mechanism, which significantly enhances the equivalent sampling frequency without compromising the quality of frame-level visual tokens. SlowFocus begins by identifying the query-related temporal segment based on the posed question, then performs dense sampling on this segment to extract local high-frequency features. A multi-frequency mixing attention module is further leveraged to aggregate these local high-frequency details with global low-frequency contexts for enhanced temporal comprehension. Additionally, to tailor Vid-LLMs to this innovative mechanism, we introduce a set of training strategies aimed at bolstering both temporal grounding and detailed temporal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we establish FineAction-CGR, a benchmark specifically devised to assess the ability of Vid-LLMs to process fine-grained temporal understanding tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our mechanism across both existing public video understanding benchmarks and our proposed FineAction-CGR.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 and 4: Introduces a new mechanism (SlowFocus) for fine-grained temporal understanding in video LLMs (Vid-LLMs), and establishes a new benchmark (FineAction-CGR). Advances vision foundation models and their application to video understanding.

## 6. [VIRAL: Visual In-Context Reasoning via Analogy in Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03210) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03210
**Authors:** Zhiwen Li, Zhongjie Duan, Jinyan Ye, Cen Chen, Daoyuan Chen, Yaliang Li, Yingda Chen

**Abstract:**  Replicating In-Context Learning (ICL) in computer vision remains challenging due to task heterogeneity. We propose \textbf{VIRAL}, a framework that elicits visual reasoning from a pre-trained image editing model by formulating ICL as conditional generation via visual analogy ($x_s : x_t :: x_q : y_q$). We adapt a frozen Diffusion Transformer (DiT) using role-aware multi-image conditioning and introduce a Mixture-of-Experts LoRA to mitigate gradient interference across diverse tasks. Additionally, to bridge the gaps in current visual context datasets, we curate a large-scale dataset spanning perception, restoration, and editing. Experiments demonstrate that VIRAL outperforms existing methods, validating that a unified V-ICL paradigm can handle the majority of visual tasks, including open-domain editing. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/VIRAL-744A

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2: Shows new VLLMs or MLLMs. Proposes VIRAL, a visual in-context learning framework using diffusion transformers for visual reasoning.

## 7. [SwiftVLM: Efficient Vision-Language Model Inference via Cross-Layer Token Bypass](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03134) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03134
**Authors:** Chen Qian, Xinran Yu, Danyang Li, Guoxuan Chi, Zheng Yang, Qiang Ma, Xin Miao

**Abstract:**  Visual token pruning is a promising approach for reducing the computational cost of vision-language models (VLMs), and existing methods often rely on early pruning decisions to improve efficiency. While effective on coarse-grained reasoning tasks, they suffer from significant performance degradation on tasks requiring fine-grained visual details. Through layer-wise analysis, we reveal substantial discrepancies in visual token importance across layers, showing that tokens deemed unimportant at shallow layers can later become highly relevant for text-conditioned reasoning. To avoid irreversible critical information loss caused by premature pruning, we introduce a new pruning paradigm, termed bypass, which preserves unselected visual tokens and forwards them to subsequent pruning stages for re-evaluation. Building on this paradigm, we propose SwiftVLM, a simple and training-free method that performs pruning at model-specific layers with strong visual token selection capability, while enabling independent pruning decisions across layers. Experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that SwiftVLM consistently outperforms existing pruning strategies, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and more faithful visual token selection behavior.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new VLLMs, specifically efficient inference for vision-language models) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). SwiftVLM introduces a new pruning paradigm for VLMs, improving efficiency without sacrificing fine-grained reasoning.

## 8. [Z3D: Zero-Shot 3D Visual Grounding from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03361) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03361
**Authors:** Nikita Drozdov, Andrey Lemeshko, Nikita Gavrilov, Anton Konushin, Danila Rukhovich, Maksim Kolodiazhnyi

**Abstract:**  3D visual grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in a 3D scene based on natural language queries. In this work, we explore zero-shot 3DVG from multi-view images alone, without requiring any geometric supervision or object priors. We introduce Z3D, a universal grounding pipeline that flexibly operates on multi-view images while optionally incorporating camera poses and depth maps. We identify key bottlenecks in prior zero-shot methods causing significant performance degradation and address them with (i) a state-of-the-art zero-shot 3D instance segmentation method to generate high-quality 3D bounding box proposals and (ii) advanced reasoning via prompt-based segmentation, which utilizes full capabilities of modern VLMs. Extensive experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among zero-shot methods. Code is available at https://github.com/col14m/z3d .

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (spatial understanding in embodied agents) and criterion 3 (novel zero-shot 3D visual grounding pipeline, new methods for 3D spatial reasoning from images). Z3D introduces a universal pipeline for zero-shot 3D visual grounding, addressing limitations in prior methods.

## 9. [EventNeuS: 3D Mesh Reconstruction from a Single Event Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03847) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03847
**Authors:** Shreyas Sachan, Viktor Rudnev, Mohamed Elgharib, Christian Theobalt, Vladislav Golyanik

**Abstract:**  Event cameras offer a considerable alternative to RGB cameras in many scenarios. While there are recent works on event-based novel-view synthesis, dense 3D mesh reconstruction remains scarcely explored and existing event-based techniques are severely limited in their 3D reconstruction accuracy. To address this limitation, we present EventNeuS, a self-supervised neural model for learning 3D representations from monocular colour event streams. Our approach, for the first time, combines 3D signed distance function and density field learning with event-based supervision. Furthermore, we introduce spherical harmonics encodings into our model for enhanced handling of view-dependent effects. EventNeuS outperforms existing approaches by a significant margin, achieving 34% lower Chamfer distance and 31% lower mean absolute error on average compared to the best previous method.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (methodological improvements to spatial understanding on embodied agents) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Proposes EventNeuS, a new self-supervised neural model for 3D mesh reconstruction from event cameras, combining SDF and density field learning with event-based supervision, which is a novel approach to spatial representation.

## 10. [Aligning Forest and Trees in Images and Long Captions for Visually Grounded Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02977) <a id="link10"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.02977
**Authors:** Byeongju Woo, Zilin Wang, Byeonghyun Pak, Sangwoo Mo, Stella X. Yu

**Abstract:**  Large vision-language models such as CLIP struggle with long captions because they align images and texts as undifferentiated wholes. Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires hierarchical semantics capturing both global context and localized details across visual and textual domains. Yet linguistic hierarchies from syntax or semantics rarely match visual organization, and purely visual hierarchies tend to fragment scenes into appearance-driven parts without semantic focus. We propose CAFT (Cross-domain Alignment of Forests and Trees), a hierarchical image-text representation learning framework that aligns global and local semantics across images and long captions without pixel-level supervision. Coupling a fine-to-coarse visual encoder with a hierarchical text transformer, it uses a hierarchical alignment loss that matches whole images with whole captions while biasing region-sentence correspondences, so that coarse semantics are built from fine-grained evidence rather than from aggregation untethered to part-level grounding. Trained on 30M image-text pairs, CAFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six long-text retrieval benchmarks and exhibits strong scaling behavior. Experiments show that hierarchical cross-domain alignment enables fine-grained, visually grounded image-text representations to emerge without explicit region-level supervision.

**Comment:** CAFT introduces a hierarchical image-text representation learning framework for visually grounded understanding, aligning global and local semantics. This matches criterion 2 (new VLLMs/MLLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications).

## 11. [3D-Aware Implicit Motion Control for View-Adaptive Human Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03796) <a id="link11"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03796
**Authors:** Zhixue Fang, Xu He, Songlin Tang, Haoxian Zhang, Qingfeng Li, Xiaoqiang Liu, Pengfei Wan, Kun Gai

**Abstract:**  Existing methods for human motion control in video generation typically rely on either 2D poses or explicit 3D parametric models (e.g., SMPL) as control signals. However, 2D poses rigidly bind motion to the driving viewpoint, precluding novel-view synthesis. Explicit 3D models, though structurally informative, suffer from inherent inaccuracies (e.g., depth ambiguity and inaccurate dynamics) which, when used as a strong constraint, override the powerful intrinsic 3D awareness of large-scale video generators. In this work, we revisit motion control from a 3D-aware perspective, advocating for an implicit, view-agnostic motion representation that naturally aligns with the generator's spatial priors rather than depending on externally reconstructed constraints. We introduce 3DiMo, which jointly trains a motion encoder with a pretrained video generator to distill driving frames into compact, view-agnostic motion tokens, injected semantically via cross-attention. To foster 3D awareness, we train with view-rich supervision (i.e., single-view, multi-view, and moving-camera videos), forcing motion consistency across diverse viewpoints. Additionally, we use auxiliary geometric supervision that leverages SMPL only for early initialization and is annealed to zero, enabling the model to transition from external 3D guidance to learning genuine 3D spatial motion understanding from the data and the generator's priors. Experiments confirm that 3DiMo faithfully reproduces driving motions with flexible, text-driven camera control, significantly surpassing existing methods in both motion fidelity and visual quality.

**Comment:** 3DiMo introduces a 3D-aware, implicit, view-agnostic motion representation for human video generation, focusing on spatial understanding and spatial intelligence in generative models. This matches criterion 1 (spatial intelligence/methodological improvement for spatial understanding in embodied agents) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications).

**Abstract:**  While multimodal reasoning models (MLRMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities, they remain prone to hallucinations, and effective solutions are still underexplored. In this paper, we experimentally analyze the hallucination cause and propose C3PO, a training-based mitigation framework comprising \textbf{C}hain-of-Thought \textbf{C}ompression and \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization. Firstly, we identify that introducing reasoning mechanisms exacerbates models' reliance on language priors while overlooking visual inputs, which can produce CoTs with reduced visual cues but redundant text tokens. To this end, we propose to selectively filter redundant thinking tokens for a more compact and signal-efficient CoT representation that preserves task-relevant information while suppressing noise. In addition, we observe that the quality of the reasoning trace largely determines whether hallucination emerges in subsequent responses. To leverage this insight, we introduce a reasoning-enhanced preference tuning scheme that constructs training pairs using high-quality AI feedback. We further design a multimodal hallucination-inducing mechanism that elicits models' inherent hallucination patterns via carefully crafted inducers, yielding informative negative signals for contrastive correction. We provide theoretical justification for the effectiveness and demonstrate consistent hallucination reduction across diverse MLRMs and benchmarks.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2: Proposes a new training-based framework (C3PO) to mitigate hallucination in multimodal reasoning models (MLRMs), with theoretical and empirical analysis. Focuses on improving VLLMs/MLLMs.

**Authors:** Jana Zeller, Thadd\"aus Wiedemer, Fanfei Li, Thomas Klein, Prasanna Mayilvahanan, Matthias Bethge, Felix Wichmann, Ryan Cotterell, Wieland Brendel

**Abstract:**  Frontier models are transitioning from multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that merely ingest visual information to unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of native interleaved generation. This shift has sparked interest in using intermediate visualizations as a reasoning aid, akin to human mental imagery. Central to this idea is the ability to form, maintain, and manipulate visual representations in a goal-oriented manner. To evaluate and probe this capability, we develop MentisOculi, a procedural, stratified suite of multi-step reasoning problems amenable to visual solution, tuned to challenge frontier models. Evaluating visual strategies ranging from latent tokens to explicit generated imagery, we find they generally fail to improve performance. Analysis of UMMs specifically exposes a critical limitation: While they possess the textual reasoning capacity to solve a task and can sometimes generate correct visuals, they suffer from compounding generation errors and fail to leverage even ground-truth visualizations. Our findings suggest that despite their inherent appeal, visual thoughts do not yet benefit model reasoning. MentisOculi establishes the necessary foundation to analyze and close this gap across diverse model families.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2: Evaluates unified multimodal models (UMMs) and MLLMs on a new benchmark (MentisOculi) for visual reasoning with mental imagery. Provides empirical insights into the limits of current models' visual reasoning abilities.

## 14. [Flexible Geometric Guidance for Probabilistic Human Pose Estimation with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03126) <a id="link14"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03126
**Authors:** Francis Snelgar, Ming Xu, Stephen Gould, Liang Zheng, Akshay Asthana

**Abstract:**  3D human pose estimation from 2D images is a challenging problem due to depth ambiguity and occlusion. Because of these challenges the task is underdetermined, where there exists multiple -- possibly infinite -- poses that are plausible given the image. Despite this, many prior works assume the existence of a deterministic mapping and estimate a single pose given an image. Furthermore, methods based on machine learning require a large amount of paired 2D-3D data to train and suffer from generalization issues to unseen scenarios. To address both of these issues, we propose a framework for pose estimation using diffusion models, which enables sampling from a probability distribution over plausible poses which are consistent with a 2D image. Our approach falls under the guidance framework for conditional generation, and guides samples from an unconditional diffusion model, trained only on 3D data, using the gradients of the heatmaps from a 2D keypoint detector. We evaluate our method on the Human 3.6M dataset under best-of-$m$ multiple hypothesis evaluation, showing state-of-the-art performance among methods which do not require paired 2D-3D data for training. We additionally evaluate the generalization ability using the MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW datasets and demonstrate competitive performance. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by using it for novel tasks including pose generation and pose completion, without the need to train bespoke conditional models. We make code available at https://github.com/fsnelgar/diffusion_pose .

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1: Presents a new diffusion-based framework for probabilistic 3D human pose estimation from 2D images, with flexible geometric guidance and applications to pose generation and completion. This is a methodological improvement in spatial understanding for embodied agents.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03294
**Authors:** Jonas K\"uhne, Christian Vogt, Michele Magno, Luca Benini

**Abstract:**  Accurate, infrastructure-less sensor systems for motion tracking are essential for mobile robotics and augmented reality (AR) applications. The most popular state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry (VIO) systems, however, are too computationally demanding for resource-constrained hardware, such as micro-drones and smart glasses. This work presents LEVIO, a fully featured VIO pipeline optimized for ultra-low-power compute platforms, allowing six-degrees-of-freedom (DoF) real-time sensing. LEVIO incorporates established VIO components such as Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) feature tracking and bundle adjustment, while emphasizing a computationally efficient architecture with parallelization and low memory usage to suit embedded microcontrollers and low-power systems-on-chip (SoCs). The paper proposes and details the algorithmic design choices and the hardware-software co-optimization approach, and presents real-time performance on resource-constrained hardware. LEVIO is validated on a parallel-processing ultra-low-power RISC-V SoC, achieving 20 FPS while consuming less than 100 mW, and benchmarked against public VIO datasets, offering a compelling balance between efficiency and accuracy. To facilitate reproducibility and adoption, the complete implementation is released as open-source.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (methodological improvements to spatial understanding on embodied agents) and criterion 3 (embodied AI, new methods for resource-constrained VIO). Presents LEVIO, a lightweight visual-inertial odometry pipeline for embedded devices, with algorithmic and hardware-software co-optimization, which is a novel angle for embodied AI in resource-constrained settings.

## 16. [ConsistentRFT: Reducing Visual Hallucinations in Flow-based Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03425) <a id="link16"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03425
**Authors:** Xiaofeng Tan, Jun Liu, Yuanting Fan, Bin-Bin Gao, Xi Jiang, Xiaochen Chen, Jinlong Peng, Chengjie Wang, Hongsong Wang, Feng Zheng

**Abstract:**  Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on flow-based models is crucial for preference alignment. However, they often introduce visual hallucinations like over-optimized details and semantic misalignment. This work preliminarily explores why visual hallucinations arise and how to reduce them. We first investigate RFT methods from a unified perspective, and reveal the core problems stemming from two aspects, exploration and exploitation: (1) limited exploration during stochastic differential equation (SDE) rollouts, leading to an over-emphasis on local details at the expense of global semantics, and (2) trajectory imitation process inherent in policy gradient methods, distorting the model's foundational vector field and its cross-step consistency. Building on this, we propose ConsistentRFT, a general framework to mitigate these hallucinations. Specifically, we design a Dynamic Granularity Rollout (DGR) mechanism to balance exploration between global semantics and local details by dynamically scheduling different noise sources. We then introduce a Consistent Policy Gradient Optimization (CPGO) that preserves the model's consistency by aligning the current policy with a more stable prior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistentRFT significantly mitigates visual hallucinations, achieving average reductions of 49\% for low-level and 38\% for high-level perceptual hallucinations. Furthermore, ConsistentRFT outperforms other RFT methods on out-of-domain metrics, showing an improvement of 5.1\% (v.s. the baseline's decrease of -0.4\%) over FLUX1.dev. This is \href{https://xiaofeng-tan.github.io/projects/ConsistentRFT}{Project Page}.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (methodological improvements to spatial understanding in generative models) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and their applications). The paper proposes a new framework (ConsistentRFT) to reduce visual hallucinations in flow-based reinforcement fine-tuning, with novel mechanisms for balancing exploration and exploitation in generative models, which is highly relevant to spatial intelligence and generative modeling.

## 17. [Gromov Wasserstein Optimal Transport for Semantic Correspondences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03105) <a id="link17"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03105
**Authors:** Francis Snelgar, Stephen Gould, Ming Xu, Liang Zheng, Akshay Asthana

**Abstract:**  Establishing correspondences between image pairs is a long studied problem in computer vision. With recent large-scale foundation models showing strong zero-shot performance on downstream tasks including classification and segmentation, there has been interest in using the internal feature maps of these models for the semantic correspondence task. Recent works observe that features from DINOv2 and Stable Diffusion (SD) are complementary, the former producing accurate but sparse correspondences, while the latter produces spatially consistent correspondences. As a result, current state-of-the-art methods for semantic correspondence involve combining features from both models in an ensemble. While the performance of these methods is impressive, they are computationally expensive, requiring evaluating feature maps from large-scale foundation models. In this work we take a different approach, instead replacing SD features with a superior matching algorithm which is imbued with the desirable spatial consistency property. Specifically, we replace the standard nearest neighbours matching with an optimal transport algorithm that includes a Gromov Wasserstein spatial smoothness prior. We show that we can significantly boost the performance of the DINOv2 baseline, and be competitive and sometimes surpassing state-of-the-art methods using Stable Diffusion features, while being 5--10x more efficient. We make code available at https://github.com/fsnelgar/semantic_matching_gwot .

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.02765
**Authors:** Haruhiko Murata, Kazuhiro Hotta

**Abstract:**  Vision Transformers (ViT) have been established as large-scale foundation models. However, because self-attention operates globally, they lack an explicit mechanism to distinguish foreground from background. As a result, ViT may learn unnecessary background features and artifacts, leading to degraded classification performance. To address this issue, we propose SVD-ViT, which leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to prioritize the learning of foreground features. SVD-ViT consists of three components-\textbf{SPC module}, \textbf{SSVA}, and \textbf{ID-RSVD}-and suppresses task-irrelevant factors such as background noise and artifacts by extracting and aggregating singular vectors that capture object foreground information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves classification accuracy and effectively learns informative foreground representations while reducing the impact of background noise.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4: Vision foundation models related and its applications. Proposes SVD-ViT, a method to improve ViT's focus on foreground features.

## 19. [Learning Abstractions for Hierarchical Planning in Program-Synthesis Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00929) <a id="link19"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.00929
**Authors:** Zergham Ahmed, Kazuki Irie, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Christopher J. Bates, Samuel J. Gershman

**Abstract:**  Humans learn abstractions and use them to plan efficiently to quickly generalize across tasks -- an ability that remains challenging for state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) agents and deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems. Inspired by the cognitive science of how people form abstractions and intuitive theories of their world knowledge, Theory-Based RL (TBRL) systems, such as TheoryCoder, exhibit strong generalization through effective use of abstractions. However, they heavily rely on human-provided abstractions and sidestep the abstraction-learning problem. We introduce TheoryCoder-2, a new TBRL agent that leverages LLMs' in-context learning ability to actively learn reusable abstractions rather than relying on hand-specified ones, by synthesizing abstractions from experience and integrating them into a hierarchical planning process. We conduct experiments on diverse environments, including BabyAI, Minihack and VGDL games like Sokoban. We find that TheoryCoder-2 is significantly more sample-efficient than baseline LLM agents augmented with classical planning domain construction, reasoning-based planning, and prior program-synthesis agents such as WorldCoder. TheoryCoder-2 is able to solve complex tasks that the baselines fail, while only requiring minimal human prompts, unlike prior TBRL systems.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (embodied AI, new methods for hierarchical planning and abstraction learning in agents, with experiments in BabyAI and Minihack). The paper introduces a new agent that learns abstractions for planning, a novel angle in program-synthesis agents.

## 20. [TIDE: Trajectory-based Diagnostic Evaluation of Test-Time Improvement in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02196) <a id="link20"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.02196
**Authors:** Hang Yan, Xinyu Che, Fangzhi Xu, Qiushi Sun, Zichen Ding, Kanzhi Cheng, Jian Zhang, Tao Qin, Jun Liu, Qika Lin

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in autonomous LLM agents demonstrate their ability to improve performance through iterative interaction with the environment. We define this paradigm as Test-Time Improvement (TTI). However, the mechanisms under how and why TTI succeed or fail remain poorly understood, and existing evaluation metrics fail to capture their task optimization efficiency, behavior adaptation after erroneous actions, and the specific utility of working memory for task completion. To address these gaps, we propose Test-time Improvement Diagnostic Evaluation (TIDE), an agent-agnostic and environment-agnostic framework that decomposes TTI into three comprehensive and interconnected dimensions. The framework measures (1) the overall temporal dynamics of task completion and (2) identifies whether performance is primarily constrained by recursive looping behaviors or (3) by burdensome accumulated memory. Through extensive experiments across diverse agents and environments, TIDE highlights that improving agent performance requires more than scaling internal reasoning, calling for explicitly optimizing the interaction dynamics between the agent and the environment.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (embodied AI, new benchmark and diagnostic framework for agent-environment interaction). Proposes TIDE, a new diagnostic evaluation framework for test-time improvement in LLM agents, focusing on agent-environment interaction dynamics, which is a novel angle for embodied AI evaluation.

## 21. [Evolving from Tool User to Creator via Training-Free Experience Reuse in Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01983) <a id="link21"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.01983
**Authors:** Xintian Shen, Jiawei Chen, Lihao Zheng, Hao Ma, Tao Wei, Kun Zhan

**Abstract:**  Existing Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) models have effectively extended the question-answering capabilities of LLMs by incorporating external tools. However, real-world scenarios present numerous open-ended problems where fixed tools often fail to meet task requirements. Furthermore, the lack of self-optimization mechanisms means that erroneous tool outputs can mislead the LLM's responses. Additionally, the construction of existing tools entails significant manual effort, which consequently constrains their applicability. Recognizing that the reasoning traces of LLMs encapsulate implicit problem-solving capabilities, we propose UCT, a novel training-free framework that transforms agents from tool users to tool creators. This approach harvests reasoning experiences and distills them into reusable assets. This method transforms the agent from a mere tool user into a tool creator, enabling adaptive tool creation and self-updating during the inference process. We also introduce a memory consolidation mechanism to maintain the tool library, ensuring high reusability of retained experiential memory for subsequent reasoning tasks. This novel automated tool construction paradigm continuously improves tool quality during reasoning, allowing the overall agent system to progress without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method serves as a novel paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of TIR models. In particular, the significant performance gains achieved +20.86%$\uparrow$ and +23.04%$\uparrow$ on benchmarks across multi-domain mathematical and scientific reasoning tasks validate the self-evolving capability of the agent.

**Comment:** UCT is a training-free framework for evolving agents from tool users to tool creators in multimodal reasoning, with a memory consolidation mechanism. This matches criterion 3 (embodied AI, new methods for agentic tool use) and is also relevant to criterion 2 (multimodal LLMs).

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03007
**Authors:** Rahul Atul Bhope, K. R. Jayaram, Vinod Muthusamy, Ritesh Kumar, Vatche Isahagian, Nalini Venkatasubramanian

**Abstract:**  Despite significant costs from retrieving and processing high-fidelity visual inputs, most multimodal vision-language systems operate at fixed fidelity levels. We introduce VOILA, a framework for Value-Of-Information-driven adaptive fidelity selection in Visual Question Answering (VQA) that optimizes what information to retrieve before model execution. Given a query, VOILA uses a two-stage pipeline: a gradient-boosted regressor estimates correctness likelihood at each fidelity from question features alone, then an isotonic calibrator refines these probabilities for reliable decision-making. The system selects the minimum-cost fidelity maximizing expected utility given predicted accuracy and retrieval costs. We evaluate VOILA across three deployment scenarios using five datasets (VQA-v2, GQA, TextVQA, LoCoMo, FloodNet) and six Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with 7B-235B parameters. VOILA consistently achieves 50-60% cost reductions while retaining 90-95% of full-resolution accuracy across diverse query types and model architectures, demonstrating that pre-retrieval fidelity selection is vital to optimize multimodal inference under resource constraints.

**Comment:** VOILA proposes a value-of-information-driven adaptive fidelity selection for multimodal VQA, optimizing resource use in vision-language models. This is a methodological improvement for VLMs (criterion 2) and relates to vision foundation model applications (criterion 4).

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03594
**Authors:** Alireza Salehi, Ehsan Karami, Sepehr Noey, Sahand Noey, Makoto Yamada, Reshad Hosseini, Mohammad Sabokrou

**Abstract:**  Anomaly detection identifies departures from expected behavior in safety-critical settings. When target-domain normal data are unavailable, zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) leverages vision-language models (VLMs). However, CLIP's coarse image-text alignment limits both localization and detection due to (i) spatial misalignment and (ii) weak sensitivity to fine-grained anomalies; prior work compensates with complex auxiliary modules yet largely overlooks the choice of backbone. We revisit the backbone and use TIPS-a VLM trained with spatially aware objectives. While TIPS alleviates CLIP's issues, it exposes a distributional gap between global and local features. We address this with decoupled prompts-fixed for image-level detection and learnable for pixel-level localization-and by injecting local evidence into the global score. Without CLIP-specific tricks, our TIPS-based pipeline improves image-level performance by 1.1-3.9% and pixel-level by 1.5-6.9% across seven industrial datasets, delivering strong generalization with a lean architecture. Code is available at github.com/AlirezaSalehy/Tipsomaly.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.01884
**Authors:** Shidong Yang, Tongwen Huang, Hao Wen, Yong Wang, Li Chen, Xiangxiang Chu

**Abstract:**  Multimodal reward models are crucial for aligning multimodal large language models with human preferences. Recent works have incorporated reasoning capabilities into these models, achieving promising results. However, training these models suffers from two critical challenges: (1) the inherent noise in preference datasets, which degrades model performance, and (2) the inefficiency of conventional training methods, which ignore the differences in sample difficulty. In this paper, we identify a strong correlation between response entropy and accuracy, indicating that entropy can serve as a reliable and unsupervised proxy for annotation noise and sample difficulty. Based on this insight, we propose a novel Entropy-Guided Training (EGT) approach for multimodal reasoning reward models, which combines two strategies: (1) entropy-guided data curation to mitigate the impact of unreliable samples, and (2) an entropy-guided training strategy that progressively introduces more complex examples. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks show that the EGT-trained model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal reward models.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (multimodal large language models, specifically reward models for multimodal reasoning). Proposes an entropy-guided training approach for data-efficient training of multimodal reward models.

## 25. [A3-TTA: Adaptive Anchor Alignment Test-Time Adaptation for Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03292) <a id="link25"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03292
**Authors:** Jianghao Wu, Xiangde Luo, Yubo Zhou, Lianming Wu, Guotai Wang, Shaoting Zhang

**Abstract:**  Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) offers a practical solution for deploying image segmentation models under domain shift without accessing source data or retraining. Among existing TTA strategies, pseudo-label-based methods have shown promising performance. However, they often rely on perturbation-ensemble heuristics (e.g., dropout sampling, test-time augmentation, Gaussian noise), which lack distributional grounding and yield unstable training signals. This can trigger error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting during adaptation. To address this, we propose \textbf{A3-TTA}, a TTA framework that constructs reliable pseudo-labels through anchor-guided supervision. Specifically, we identify well-predicted target domain images using a class compact density metric, under the assumption that confident predictions imply distributional proximity to the source domain. These anchors serve as stable references to guide pseudo-label generation, which is further regularized via semantic consistency and boundary-aware entropy minimization. Additionally, we introduce a self-adaptive exponential moving average strategy to mitigate label noise and stabilize model update during adaptation. Evaluated on both multi-domain medical images (heart structure and prostate segmentation) and natural images, A3-TTA significantly improves average Dice scores by 10.40 to 17.68 percentage points compared to the source model, outperforming several state-of-the-art TTA methods under different segmentation model architectures. A3-TTA also excels in continual TTA, maintaining high performance across sequential target domains with strong anti-forgetting ability. The code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/A3-TTA.

**Comment:** Somewhat matches criterion 1 (methodological improvements to spatial understanding) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Proposes a new test-time adaptation framework for image segmentation, with novel anchor-guided supervision and regularization strategies, which could be of interest for spatial intelligence and robust vision models.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03038
**Authors:** Cassidy Langenfeld, Claas Beger, Gloria Geng, Wasu Top Piriyakulkij, Keya Hu, Yewen Pu, Kevin Ellis

**Abstract:**  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made great strides in everyday visual tasks, such as captioning a natural image, or answering commonsense questions about such images. But humans possess the puzzling ability to deploy their visual reasoning abilities in radically new situations, a skill rigorously tested by the classic set of visual reasoning challenges known as the Bongard problems. We present a neurosymbolic approach to solving these problems: given a hypothesized solution rule for a Bongard problem, we leverage LLMs to generate parameterized programmatic representations for the rule and perform parameter fitting using Bayesian optimization. We evaluate our method on classifying Bongard problem images given the ground truth rule, as well as on solving the problems from scratch.

**Comment:** Partially matches criterion 2: Uses LLMs and neurosymbolic approaches for visual reasoning on Bongard problems, but does not introduce a new VLLM/MLLM. Interesting for vision-language reasoning, but not a new model.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03264
**Authors:** Francesco Di Salvo, Sebastian Doerrich, Jonas Alle, Christian Ledig

**Abstract:**  Robust generalization beyond training distributions remains a critical challenge for deep neural networks. This is especially pronounced in medical image analysis, where data is often scarce and covariate shifts arise from different hardware devices, imaging protocols, and heterogeneous patient populations. These factors collectively hinder reliable performance and slow down clinical adoption. Despite recent progress, existing learning paradigms primarily rely on the Euclidean manifold, whose flat geometry fails to capture the complex, hierarchical structures present in clinical data. In this work, we exploit the advantages of hyperbolic manifolds to model complex data characteristics. We present the first comprehensive validation of hyperbolic representation learning for medical image analysis and demonstrate statistically significant gains across eleven in-distribution datasets and three ViT models. We further propose an unsupervised, domain-invariant hyperbolic cross-branch consistency constraint. Extensive experiments confirm that our proposed method promotes domain-invariant features and outperforms state-of-the-art Euclidean methods by an average of $+2.1\%$ AUC on three domain generalization benchmarks: Fitzpatrick17k, Camelyon17-WILDS, and a cross-dataset setup for retinal imaging. These datasets span different imaging modalities, data sizes, and label granularities, confirming generalization capabilities across substantially different conditions. The code is available at https://github.com/francescodisalvo05/hyperbolic-cross-branch-consistency .

**Authors:** Basile Terver, Randall Balestriero, Megi Dervishi, David Fan, Quentin Garrido, Tushar Nagarajan, Koustuv Sinha, Wancong Zhang, Mike Rabbat, Yann LeCun, Amir Bar

**Abstract:**  We present EB-JEPA, an open-source library for learning representations and world models using Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs). JEPAs learn to predict in representation space rather than pixel space, avoiding the pitfalls of generative modeling while capturing semantically meaningful features suitable for downstream tasks. Our library provides modular, self-contained implementations that illustrate how representation learning techniques developed for image-level self-supervised learning can transfer to video, where temporal dynamics add complexity, and ultimately to action-conditioned world models, where the model must additionally learn to predict the effects of control inputs. Each example is designed for single-GPU training within a few hours, making energy-based self-supervised learning accessible for research and education. We provide ablations of JEA components on CIFAR-10. Probing these representations yields 91% accuracy, indicating that the model learns useful features. Extending to video, we include a multi-step prediction example on Moving MNIST that demonstrates how the same principles scale to temporal modeling. Finally, we show how these representations can drive action-conditioned world models, achieving a 97% planning success rate on the Two Rooms navigation task. Comprehensive ablations reveal the critical importance of each regularization component for preventing representation collapse. Code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/eb_jepa.

**Comment:** Somewhat relevant to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications), as it provides a library for energy-based joint-embedding predictive architectures for images, video, and action-conditioned world models. However, it is more of a toolkit than a new method or benchmark.

**Authors:** Minhua Lin, Enyan Dai, Hui Liu, Xianfeng Tang, Yuliang Yan, Zhenwei Dai, Jingying Zeng, Zhiwei Zhang, Fali Wang, Hongcheng Gao, Chen Luo, Xiang Zhang, Qi He, Suhang Wang

**Abstract:**  As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in high-stakes domains, their ability to reason strategically under uncertainty becomes critical. Poker provides a rigorous testbed, requiring not only strong actions but also principled, game-theoretic reasoning. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of LLMs in multiple realistic poker tasks, evaluating both gameplay outcomes and reasoning traces. Our analysis reveals LLMs fail to compete against traditional algorithms and identifies three recurring flaws: reliance on heuristics, factual misunderstandings, and a "knowing-doing" gap where actions diverge from reasoning. An initial attempt with behavior cloning and step-level reinforcement learning improves reasoning style but remains insufficient for accurate game-theoretic play. Motivated by these limitations, we propose ToolPoker, a tool-integrated reasoning framework that combines external solvers for GTO-consistent actions with more precise professional-style explanations. Experiments demonstrate that ToolPoker achieves state-of-the-art gameplay while producing reasoning traces that closely reflect game-theoretic principles.

**Comment:** This paper studies LLMs' strategic reasoning in poker and introduces ToolPoker, a tool-integrated reasoning framework. It is relevant to criterion 1 (methodological improvements to agentic reasoning) and criterion 3 (embodied AI/agentic tool use with a new method).

**Abstract:**  Reinforcement Learning (RL) serves as a potent paradigm for enhancing reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), yet standard outcome-based approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework designed to provide continuous reward signals, which introduces a Step-wise Marginal Information Gain (MIG) mechanism that quantifies the intrinsic value of reasoning steps against a Monotonic Historical Watermark, effectively filtering out training noise. To ensure disentangled credit distribution, we implement a Decoupled Masking Strategy, applying process-oriented rewards specifically to the chain-of-thought (CoT) and outcome-oriented rewards to the full completion. Additionally, we incorporate a Dual-Gated SFT objective to stabilize training with high-quality structural and factual signals. Extensive experiments across textual and multi-modal benchmarks (e.g., MATH, Super-CLEVR) demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines such as GRPO in both sample efficiency and final accuracy. Furthermore, our model exhibits superior out-of-distribution robustness, demonstrating promising zero-shot transfer capabilities to unseen and challenging reasoning tasks.

**Comment:** Does not directly match any criterion. Proposes a new RL-based credit assignment method for LLM reasoning, with some multi-modal benchmarks, but not focused on spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

## 31. [Beyond Output Critique: Self-Correction via Task Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00871) <a id="link31"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.00871
**Authors:** Hossein A. Rahmani, Mengting Wan, Pei Zhou, Longqi Yang, Nick Craswell, Emine Yilmaz, Sujay Kumar Jauhar

**Abstract:**  Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising self-correction abilities, where iterative refinement improves the quality of generated responses. However, most existing approaches operate at the level of output critique, patching surface errors while often failing to correct deeper reasoning flaws. We propose SELF-THOUGHT, a framework that introduces an intermediate step of task abstraction before solution refinement. Given an input and an initial response, the model first distills the task into a structured template that captures key variables, constraints, and problem structure. This abstraction then guides solution instantiation, grounding subsequent responses in a clearer understanding of the task and reducing error propagation. Crucially, we show that these abstractions can be transferred across models: templates generated by larger models can serve as structured guides for smaller LLMs, which typically struggle with intrinsic self-correction. By reusing distilled task structures, smaller models achieve more reliable refinements without heavy fine-tuning or reliance on external verifiers. Experiments across diverse reasoning tasks demonstrate that SELF-THOUGHT improves accuracy, robustness, and generalization for both large and small models, offering a scalable path toward more reliable self-correcting language systems.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a new self-correction framework for LLMs called SELF-THOUGHT, which introduces task abstraction and distillation. While it is a methodological improvement for language models, it does not focus on spatial understanding, embodied agents, VLLMs/MLLMs, vision foundation models, or embodied AI benchmarks. It is more about general LLM reasoning and self-correction.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.01090
**Authors:** Yang Liu, Chuan Zhou, Yancheng Chen, Shuai Zhang, Xixun Lin, Xiaoqing Wang

**Abstract:**  Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising general-purpose solvers for combinatorial optimization (CO), yet they fundamentally lack mechanisms to guarantee solution feasibility which is critical for real-world deployment. In this work, we introduce FALCON, a framework that ensures 100\% feasibility through three key innovations: (i) \emph{grammar-constrained decoding} enforces syntactic validity, (ii) a \emph{feasibility repair layer} corrects semantic constraint violations, and (iii) \emph{adaptive Best-of-$N$ sampling} allocates inference compute efficiently. To train the underlying LLM, we introduce the Best-anchored Objective-guided Preference Optimization (BOPO) in LLM training, which weights preference pairs by their objective gap, providing dense supervision without human labels. Theoretically, we prove convergence for BOPO and provide bounds on repair-induced quality loss. Empirically, across seven NP-hard CO problems, FALCON achieves perfect feasibility while matching or exceeding the solution quality of state-of-the-art neural and LLM-based solvers.

## 33. [RE-MCDF: Closed-Loop Multi-Expert LLM Reasoning for Knowledge-Grounded Clinical Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01297) <a id="link33"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.01297
**Authors:** Shaowei Shen, Xiaohong Yang, Jie Yang, Lianfen Huang, Yongcai Zhang, Yang Zou, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour

**Abstract:**  Electronic medical records (EMRs), particularly in neurology, are inherently heterogeneous, sparse, and noisy, which poses significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) in clinical diagnosis. In such settings, single-agent systems are vulnerable to self-reinforcing errors, as their predictions lack independent validation and can drift toward spurious conclusions. Although recent multi-agent frameworks attempt to mitigate this issue through collaborative reasoning, their interactions are often shallow and loosely structured, failing to reflect the rigorous, evidence-driven processes used by clinical experts. More fundamentally, existing approaches largely ignore the rich logical dependencies among diseases, such as mutual exclusivity, pathological compatibility, and diagnostic confusion. This limitation prevents them from ruling out clinically implausible hypotheses, even when sufficient evidence is available. To overcome these, we propose RE-MCDF, a relation-enhanced multi-expert clinical diagnosis framework. RE-MCDF introduces a generation--verification--revision closed-loop architecture that integrates three complementary components: (i) a primary expert that generates candidate diagnoses and supporting evidence, (ii) a laboratory expert that dynamically prioritizes heterogeneous clinical indicators, and (iii) a multi-relation awareness and evaluation expert group that explicitly enforces inter-disease logical constraints. Guided by a medical knowledge graph (MKG), the first two experts adaptively reweight EMR evidence, while the expert group validates and corrects candidate diagnoses to ensure logical consistency. Extensive experiments on the neurology subset of CMEMR (NEEMRs) and on our curated dataset (XMEMRs) demonstrate that RE-MCDF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in complex diagnostic scenarios.

## 34. [PRISM: Festina Lente Proactivity -- Risk-Sensitive, Uncertainty-Aware Deliberation for Proactive Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01532) <a id="link34"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.01532
**Authors:** Yuxuan Fu, Xiaoyu Tan, Teqi Hao, Chen Zhan, Xihe Qiu

**Abstract:**  Proactive agents must decide not only what to say but also whether and when to intervene. Many current systems rely on brittle heuristics or indiscriminate long reasoning, which offers little control over the benefit-burden tradeoff. We formulate the problem as cost-sensitive selective intervention and present PRISM, a novel framework that couples a decision-theoretic gate with a dual-process reasoning architecture. At inference time, the agent intervenes only when a calibrated probability of user acceptance exceeds a threshold derived from asymmetric costs of missed help and false alarms. Inspired by festina lente (Latin: "make haste slowly"), we gate by an acceptance-calibrated, cost-derived threshold and invoke a resource-intensive Slow mode with counterfactual checks only near the decision boundary, concentrating computation on ambiguous and high-stakes cases. Training uses gate-aligned, schema-locked distillation: a teacher running the full PRISM pipeline provides dense, executable supervision on unlabeled interaction traces, while the student learns a response policy that is explicitly decoupled from the intervention gate to enable tunable and auditable control. On ProactiveBench, PRISM reduces false alarms by 22.78% and improves F1 by 20.14% over strong baselines. These results show that principled decision-theoretic gating, paired with selective slow reasoning and aligned distillation, yields proactive agents that are precise, computationally efficient, and controllable. To facilitate reproducibility, we release our code, models, and resources at https://prism-festinalente.github.io/; all experiments use the open-source ProactiveBench benchmark.

## 35. [Optimizing Agentic Reasoning with Retrieval via Synthetic Semantic Information Gain Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00845) <a id="link35"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.00845
**Authors:** Senkang Hu, Yong Dai, Yuzhi Zhao, Yihang Tao, Yu Guo, Zhengru Fang, Sam Tak Wu Kwong, Yuguang Fang

**Abstract:**  Agentic reasoning enables large reasoning models (LRMs) to dynamically acquire external knowledge, but yet optimizing the retrieval process remains challenging due to the lack of dense, principled reward signals. In this paper, we introduce InfoReasoner, a unified framework that incentivizes effective information seeking via a synthetic semantic information gain reward. Theoretically, we redefine information gain as uncertainty reduction over the model's belief states, establishing guarantees, including non-negativity, telescoping additivity, and channel monotonicity. Practically, to enable scalable optimization without manual retrieval annotations, we propose an output-aware intrinsic estimator that computes information gain directly from the model's output distributions using semantic clustering via bidirectional textual entailment. This intrinsic reward guides the policy to maximize epistemic progress, enabling efficient training via Group Relative Policy Optimxization (GRPO). Experiments across seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that InfoReasoner consistently outperforms strong retrieval-augmented baselines, achieving up to 5.4% average accuracy improvement. Our work provides a theoretically grounded and scalable path toward agentic reasoning with retrieval.

**Authors:** Ankur Samanta, Akshayaa Magesh, Ayush Jain, Kavosh Asadi, Youliang Yu, Daniel Jiang, Boris Vidolov, Kaveh Hassani, Paul Sajda, Jalaj Bhandari, Yonathan Efroni

**Abstract:**  Self-correction in language models remains elusive. In this work, we explore whether language models can explicitly localize errors in incorrect reasoning, as a path toward building AI systems that can effectively correct themselves. We introduce a prompting method that structures reasoning as discrete, semantically coherent thought steps, and show that models are able to reliably localize errors within this structure, while failing to do so in conventional, unstructured chain-of-thought reasoning. Motivated by how the human brain monitors errors at discrete decision points and resamples alternatives, we introduce Iterative Correction Sampling of Thoughts (Thought-ICS), a self-correction framework. Thought-ICS iteratively prompts the model to generate reasoning one discrete and complete thought at a time--where each thought represents a deliberate decision by the model--creating natural boundaries for precise error localization. Upon verification, the model localizes the first erroneous step, and the system backtracks to generate alternative reasoning from the last correct point. When asked to correct reasoning verified as incorrect by an oracle, Thought-ICS achieves 20-40% self-correction lift. In a completely autonomous setting without external verification, it outperforms contemporary self-correction baselines.

## 37. [Continuous Control of Editing Models via Adaptive-Origin Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03826) <a id="link37"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03826
**Authors:** Alon Wolf, Chen Katzir, Kfir Aberman, Or Patashnik

**Abstract:**  Diffusion-based editing models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic image and video manipulation. However, existing models lack a mechanism for smoothly controlling the intensity of text-guided edits. In standard text-conditioned generation, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) impacts prompt adherence, suggesting it as a potential control for edit intensity in editing models. However, we show that scaling CFG in these models does not produce a smooth transition between the input and the edited result. We attribute this behavior to the unconditional prediction, which serves as the guidance origin and dominates the generation at low guidance scales, while representing an arbitrary manipulation of the input content. To enable continuous control, we introduce Adaptive-Origin Guidance (AdaOr), a method that adjusts this standard guidance origin with an identity-conditioned adaptive origin, using an identity instruction corresponding to the identity manipulation. By interpolating this identity prediction with the standard unconditional prediction according to the edit strength, we ensure a continuous transition from the input to the edited result. We evaluate our method on image and video editing tasks, demonstrating that it provides smoother and more consistent control compared to current slider-based editing approaches. Our method incorporates an identity instruction into the standard training framework, enabling fine-grained control at inference time without per-edit procedure or reliance on specialized datasets.

**Comment:** Relevant to generative modeling in vision (user's general interest), but does not directly match any specific criterion. Proposes a new method for continuous control in diffusion-based editing models.

## 38. [Dynamic High-frequency Convolution for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02969) <a id="link38"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.02969
**Authors:** Ruojing Li, Chao Xiao, Qian Yin, Wei An, Nuo Chen, Xinyi Ying, Miao Li, Yingqian Wang

**Abstract:**  Infrared small targets are typically tiny and locally salient, which belong to high-frequency components (HFCs) in images. Single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection is challenging, since there are many HFCs along with targets, such as bright corners, broken clouds, and other clutters. Current learning-based methods rely on the powerful capabilities of deep networks, but neglect explicit modeling and discriminative representation learning of various HFCs, which is important to distinguish targets from other HFCs. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a dynamic high-frequency convolution (DHiF) to translate the discriminative modeling process into the generation of a dynamic local filter bank. Especially, DHiF is sensitive to HFCs, owing to the dynamic parameters of its generated filters being symmetrically adjusted within a zero-centered range according to Fourier transformation properties. Combining with standard convolution operations, DHiF can adaptively and dynamically process different HFC regions and capture their distinctive grayscale variation characteristics for discriminative representation learning. DHiF functions as a drop-in replacement for standard convolution and can be used in arbitrary SIRST detection networks without significant decrease in computational efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of our DHiF, we conducted extensive experiments across different SIRST detection networks on real-scene datasets. Compared to other state-of-the-art convolution operations, DHiF exhibits superior detection performance with promising improvement. Codes are available at https://github.com/TinaLRJ/DHiF.

**Comment:** Dynamic High-frequency Convolution (DHiF) is a new convolution operation for infrared small target detection, focusing on explicit modeling of high-frequency components. This is a methodological improvement in computer vision, but not directly related to spatial intelligence in embodied agents or VLMs.

## 39. [Diversity-Preserved Distribution Matching Distillation for Fast Visual Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03139) <a id="link39"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03139
**Authors:** Tianhe Wu, Ruibin Li, Lei Zhang, Kede Ma

**Abstract:**  Distribution matching distillation (DMD) aligns a multi-step generator with its few-step counterpart to enable high-quality generation under low inference cost. However, DMD tends to suffer from mode collapse, as its reverse-KL formulation inherently encourages mode-seeking behavior, for which existing remedies typically rely on perceptual or adversarial regularization, thereby incurring substantial computational overhead and training instability. In this work, we propose a role-separated distillation framework that explicitly disentangles the roles of distilled steps: the first step is dedicated to preserving sample diversity via a target-prediction (e.g., v-prediction) objective, while subsequent steps focus on quality refinement under the standard DMD loss, with gradients from the DMD objective blocked at the first step. We term this approach Diversity-Preserved DMD (DP-DMD), which, despite its simplicity -- no perceptual backbone, no discriminator, no auxiliary networks, and no additional ground-truth images -- preserves sample diversity while maintaining visual quality on par with state-of-the-art methods in extensive text-to-image experiments.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a new distillation framework for fast visual synthesis, focusing on diversity preservation in generative models. It is relevant to generative modeling in vision but does not directly match any specific criterion.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.01970
**Authors:** Yun Qu, Qi Wang, Yixiu Mao, Heming Zou, Yuhang Jiang, Weijie Liu, Clive Bai, Kai Yang, Yangkun Chen, Saiyong Yang, Xiangyang Ji

**Abstract:**  Reinforcement learning enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models but often involves high computational costs due to rollout-intensive optimization. Online prompt selection presents a plausible solution by prioritizing informative prompts to improve training efficiency. However, current methods either depend on costly, exact evaluations or construct prompt-specific predictive models lacking generalization across prompts. This study introduces Generalizable Predictive Prompt Selection (GPS), which performs Bayesian inference towards prompt difficulty using a lightweight generative model trained on the shared optimization history. Intermediate-difficulty prioritization and history-anchored diversity are incorporated into the batch acquisition principle to select informative prompt batches. The small predictive model also generalizes at test-time for efficient computational allocation. Experiments across varied reasoning benchmarks indicate GPS's substantial improvements in training efficiency, final performance, and test-time efficiency over superior baseline methods.

## 41. [SPWOOD: Sparse Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03634) <a id="link41"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.03634
**Authors:** Wei Zhang, Xiang Liu, Ningjing Liu, Mingxin Liu, Wei Liao, Chunyan Xu, Xue Yang

**Abstract:**  A consistent trend throughout the research of oriented object detection has been the pursuit of maintaining comparable performance with fewer and weaker annotations. This is particularly crucial in the remote sensing domain, where the dense object distribution and a wide variety of categories contribute to prohibitively high costs. Based on the supervision level, existing oriented object detection algorithms can be broadly grouped into fully supervised, semi-supervised, and weakly supervised methods. Within the scope of this work, we further categorize them to include sparsely supervised and partially weakly-supervised methods. To address the challenges of large-scale labeling, we introduce the first Sparse Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection framework, designed to efficiently leverage only a few sparse weakly-labeled data and plenty of unlabeled data. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) We design a Sparse-annotation-Orientation-and-Scale-aware Student (SOS-Student) model to separate unlabeled objects from the background in a sparsely-labeled setting, and learn orientation and scale information from orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic weak annotations. (2) We construct a novel Multi-level Pseudo-label Filtering strategy that leverages the distribution of model predictions, which is informed by the model's multi-layer predictions. (3) We propose a unique sparse partitioning approach, ensuring equal treatment for each category. Extensive experiments on the DOTA and DIOR datasets show that our framework achieves a significant performance gain over traditional oriented object detection methods mentioned above, offering a highly cost-effective solution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/VisionXLab/SPWOOD.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.00307
**Authors:** Udayan Khurana

**Abstract:**  Traditional data processing pipelines are typically static and handcrafted for specific tasks, limiting their adaptability to evolving requirements. While general-purpose agents and coding assistants can generate code for well-understood data pipelines, they lack the ability to autonomously monitor, manage, and optimize an end-to-end pipeline once deployed. We present \textbf{Autonomous Data Processing using Meta-agents} (ADP-MA), a framework that dynamically constructs, executes, and iteratively refines data processing pipelines through hierarchical agent orchestration. At its core, \textit{meta-agents} analyze input data and task specifications to design a multi-phase plan, instantiate specialized \textit{ground-level agents}, and continuously evaluate pipeline performance. The architecture comprises three key components: a planning module for strategy generation, an orchestration layer for agent coordination and tool integration, and a monitoring loop for iterative evaluation and backtracking. Unlike conventional approaches, ADP-MA emphasizes context-aware optimization, adaptive workload partitioning, and progressive sampling for scalability. Additionally, the framework leverages a diverse set of external tools and can reuse previously designed agents, reducing redundancy and accelerating pipeline construction. We demonstrate ADP-MA through an interactive demo that showcases pipeline construction, execution monitoring, and adaptive refinement across representative data processing tasks.

**Abstract:**  Ontologies are essential for structuring domain knowledge, improving accessibility, sharing, and reuse. However, traditional ontology construction relies on manual annotation and conventional natural language processing (NLP) techniques, making the process labour-intensive and costly, especially in specialised fields like casting manufacturing. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers new possibilities for automating knowledge extraction. This study investigates three LLM-based approaches, including pre-trained LLM-driven method, in-context learning (ICL) method and fine-tuning method to extract terms and relations from domain-specific texts using limited data. We compare their performances and use the best-performing method to build a casting ontology that validated by domian expert.
