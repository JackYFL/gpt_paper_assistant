## 0. [Unleashing MLLMs on the Edge: A Unified Framework for Cross-Modal ReID via Adaptive SVD Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12936) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.12936
**Authors:** Hongbo Jiang, Jie Li, Xinqi Cai, Tianyu Xie, Yunhang Shen, Pingyang Dai, Liujuan Cao

**Abstract:**  Practical cloud-edge deployment of Cross-Modal Re-identification (CM-ReID) faces challenges due to maintaining a fragmented ecosystem of specialized cloud models for diverse modalities. While Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong unification potential, existing approaches fail to adapt them into a single end-to-end backbone and lack effective knowledge distillation strategies for edge deployment. To address these limitations, we propose MLLMEmbed-ReID, a unified framework based on a powerful cloud-edge architecture. First, we adapt a foundational MLLM into a state-of-the-art cloud model. We leverage instruction-based prompting to guide the MLLM in generating a unified embedding space across RGB, infrared, sketch, and text modalities. This model is then trained efficiently with a hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation finetuning (LoRA-SFT) strategy, optimized under a holistic cross-modal alignment objective. Second, to deploy its knowledge onto an edge-native student, we introduce a novel distillation strategy motivated by the low-rank property in the teacher's feature space. To prioritize essential information, this method employs a Principal Component Mapping loss, while relational structures are preserved via a Feature Relation loss. Our lightweight edge-based model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple visual CM-ReID benchmarks, while its cloud-based counterpart excels across all CM-ReID benchmarks. The MLLMEmbed-ReID framework thus presents a complete and effective solution for deploying unified MLLM-level intelligence on resource-constrained devices. The code and models will be open-sourced soon.

**Comment:** This paper proposes MLLMEmbed-ReID, a unified framework for cross-modal re-identification using a foundational MLLM and a novel distillation strategy for edge deployment. This directly matches criterion 2 (new MLLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications), and is highly relevant to your friend's interests.

## 1. [Vision Token Reduction via Attention-Driven Self-Compression for Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12618) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.12618
**Authors:** Omer Faruk Deniz, Ruiyu Mao, Ruochen Li, Yapeng Tian, Latifur Khan

**Abstract:**  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) incur significant computational cost from processing numerous vision tokens through all LLM layers. Prior pruning methods operate either before the LLM, limiting generality due to diverse encoder-projector designs or within the LLM using heuristics that are incompatible with FlashAttention. We take a different approach: rather than identifying unimportant tokens, we treat the LLM itself as the optimal guide for compression. Observing that deeper layers naturally transmit vision-to-text information, we introduce Attention-Driven Self-Compression (ADSC), a simple, broadly applicable method that progressively reduces vision tokens using only the LLM's attention mechanism. Our method applies uniform token downsampling at selected layers, forming bottlenecks that encourage the model to reorganize and compress information into the remaining tokens. It requires no score computation, auxiliary modules, or attention modification, and remains fully compatible with FlashAttention. Applied to LLaVA-1.5, ADSC reduces FLOPs by 53.7% and peak KV-cache memory by 56.7%, while preserving 98.2% of the original model performance. Across multiple benchmarks, it outperforms prior pruning approaches in both efficiency and accuracy. Crucially, under high compression ratios, our method remains robust while heuristic-based techniques degrade sharply.

**Comment:** This paper proposes Attention-Driven Self-Compression (ADSC) for efficient multimodal large language models (MLLMs), reducing vision token computation while maintaining performance. This directly matches criterion 2 (new MLLMs) and is also relevant to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications).

## 2. [Bootstrapping MLLM for Weakly-Supervised Class-Agnostic Object Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12774) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.12774
**Authors:** Xiaowen Zhang, Zijie Yue, Yong Luo, Cairong Zhao, Qijun Chen, Miaojing Shi

**Abstract:**  Object counting is a fundamental task in computer vision, with broad applicability in many real-world scenarios. Fully-supervised counting methods require costly point-level annotations per object. Few weakly-supervised methods leverage only image-level object counts as supervision and achieve fairly promising results. They are, however, often limited to counting a single category, e.g. person. In this paper, we propose WS-COC, the first MLLM-driven weakly-supervised framework for class-agnostic object counting. Instead of directly fine-tuning MLLMs to predict object counts, which can be challenging due to the modality gap, we incorporate three simple yet effective strategies to bootstrap the counting paradigm in both training and testing: First, a divide-and-discern dialogue tuning strategy is proposed to guide the MLLM to determine whether the object count falls within a specific range and progressively break down the range through multi-round dialogue. Second, a compare-and-rank count optimization strategy is introduced to train the MLLM to optimize the relative ranking of multiple images according to their object counts. Third, a global-and-local counting enhancement strategy aggregates and fuses local and global count predictions to improve counting performance in dense scenes. Extensive experiments on FSC-147, CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech show that WS-COC matches or even surpasses many state-of-art fully-supervised methods while significantly reducing annotation costs. Code is available at https://github.com/viscom-tongji/WS-COC.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (Shows new VLLMs or MLLMs): Proposes WS-COC, the first MLLM-driven weakly-supervised framework for class-agnostic object counting, with novel strategies for leveraging MLLMs in counting tasks. Also relevant to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications).

## 3. [EPRBench: A High-Quality Benchmark Dataset for Event Stream Based Visual Place Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12919) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.12919
**Authors:** Xiao Wang, Xingxing Xiong, Jinfeng Gao, Xufeng Lou, Bo Jiang, Si-bao Chen, Yaowei Wang, Yonghong Tian

**Abstract:**  Event stream-based Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is an emerging research direction that offers a compelling solution to the instability of conventional visible-light cameras under challenging conditions such as low illumination, overexposure, and high-speed motion. Recognizing the current scarcity of dedicated datasets in this domain, we introduce EPRBench, a high-quality benchmark specifically designed for event stream-based VPR. EPRBench comprises 10K event sequences and 65K event frames, collected using both handheld and vehicle-mounted setups to comprehensively capture real-world challenges across diverse viewpoints, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios. To support semantic-aware and language-integrated VPR research, we provide LLM-generated scene descriptions, subsequently refined through human annotation, establishing a solid foundation for integrating LLMs into event-based perception pipelines. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we implement and benchmark 15 state-of-the-art VPR algorithms on EPRBench, offering a strong baseline for future algorithmic comparisons. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion paradigm for VPR: leveraging LLMs to generate textual scene descriptions from raw event streams, which then guide spatially attentive token selection, cross-modal feature fusion, and multi-scale representation learning. This framework not only achieves highly accurate place recognition but also produces interpretable reasoning processes alongside its predictions, significantly enhancing model transparency and explainability. The dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Neuromorphic_ReID

**Comment:** This paper introduces EPRBench, a new benchmark dataset for event stream-based visual place recognition, and proposes a novel multi-modal fusion paradigm leveraging LLMs for spatially attentive token selection and cross-modal feature fusion. This matches criterion 3 (new embodied AI benchmarks and methods with novel angles) and also touches on criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications).

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.12876
**Authors:** Huanyao Zhang, Jiepeng Zhou, Bo Li, Bowen Zhou, Yanzhe Dan, Haishan Lu, Zhiyong Cao, Jiaoyang Chen, Yuqian Han, Zinan Sheng, Zhengwei Tao, Hao Liang, Jialong Wu, Yang Shi, Yuanpeng He, Jiaye Lin, Qintong Zhang, Guochen Yan, Runhao Zhao, Zhengpin Li, Xiaohan Yu, Lang Mei, Chong Chen, Wentao Zhang, Bin Cui

**Abstract:**  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), equipped with increasingly advanced planning and tool-use capabilities, are evolving into autonomous agents capable of performing multimodal web browsing and deep search in open-world environments. However, existing benchmarks for multimodal browsing remain limited in task complexity, evidence accessibility, and evaluation granularity, hindering comprehensive and reproducible assessments of deep search capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce BrowseComp-$V^3$, a novel benchmark consisting of 300 carefully curated and challenging questions spanning diverse domains. The benchmark emphasizes deep, multi-level, and cross-modal multi-hop reasoning, where critical evidence is interleaved across textual and visual modalities within and across web pages. All supporting evidence is strictly required to be publicly searchable, ensuring fairness and reproducibility. Beyond final-answer accuracy, we incorporate an expert-validated, subgoal-driven process evaluation mechanism that enables fine-grained analysis of intermediate reasoning behaviors and systematic characterization of capability boundaries. In addition, we propose OmniSeeker, a unified multimodal browsing agent framework integrating diverse web search and visual perception tools. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models achieve only 36% accuracy on our benchmark, revealing critical bottlenecks in multimodal information integration and fine-grained perception. Our results highlight a fundamental gap between current model capabilities and robust multimodal deep search in real-world settings.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (MLLMs/VLLMs) and criterion 3 (new benchmark for embodied/agentic AI). Introduces a challenging benchmark (BrowseComp-$V^3$) for multimodal browsing agents, focusing on deep, cross-modal reasoning and evaluation of MLLMs as agents.

## 5. [Thinking Like a Radiologist: A Dataset for Anatomy-Guided Interleaved Vision Language Reasoning in Chest X-ray Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12843) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.12843
**Authors:** Yichen Zhao, Zelin Peng, Piao Yang, Xiaokang Yang, Wei Shen

**Abstract:**  Radiological diagnosis is a perceptual process in which careful visual inspection and language reasoning are repeatedly interleaved. Most medical large vision language models (LVLMs) perform visual inspection only once and then rely on text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which operates purely in the linguistic space and is prone to hallucination. Recent methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing visually related coordinates, such as bounding boxes. However, these remain a pseudo-visual solution: coordinates are still text and fail to preserve rich visual details like texture and density. Motivated by the interleaved nature of radiological diagnosis, we introduce MMRad-IVL-22K, the first large-scale dataset designed for natively interleaved visual language reasoning in chest X-ray interpretation. MMRad-IVL-22K reflects a repeated cycle of reasoning and visual inspection workflow of radiologists, in which visual rationales complement textual descriptions and ground each step of the reasoning process. MMRad-IVL-22K comprises 21,994 diagnostic traces, enabling systematic scanning across 35 anatomical regions. Experimental results on advanced closed-source LVLMs demonstrate that report generation guided by multimodal CoT significantly outperforms that guided by text-only CoT in clinical accuracy and report quality (e.g., 6\% increase in the RadGraph metric), confirming that high-fidelity interleaved vision language evidence is a non-substitutable component of reliable medical AI. Furthermore, benchmarking across seven state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs demonstrates that models fine-tuned on MMRad-IVL-22K achieve superior reasoning consistency and report quality compared with both general-purpose and medical-specific LVLMs. The project page is available at https://github.com/qiuzyc/thinking_like_a_radiologist.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (Shows new VLLMs or MLLMs): Introduces MMRad-IVL-22K, a large-scale dataset for interleaved vision-language reasoning in chest X-ray interpretation, and benchmarks multiple LVLMs, showing empirical improvements with multimodal chain-of-thought. Also relevant to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) due to its focus on LVLMs in medical imaging.

## 6. [SkillsBench: Benchmarking How Well Agent Skills Work Across Diverse Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12670) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.12670
**Authors:** Xiangyi Li, Wenbo Chen, Yimin Liu, Shenghan Zheng, Xiaokun Chen, Yifeng He, Yubo Li, Bingran You, Haotian Shen, Jiankai Sun, Shuyi Wang, Qunhong Zeng, Di Wang, Xuandong Zhao, Yuanli Wang, Roey Ben Chaim, Zonglin Di, Yipeng Gao, Junwei He, Yizhuo He, Liqiang Jing, Luyang Kong, Xin Lan, Jiachen Li, Songlin Li, Yijiang Li, Yueqian Lin, Xinyi Liu, Xuanqing Liu, Haoran Lyu, Ze Ma, Bowei Wang, Runhui Wang, Tianyu Wang, Wengao Ye, Yue Zhang, Hanwen Xing, Yiqi Xue, Steven Dillmann, Han-chung Lee

**Abstract:**  Agent Skills are structured packages of procedural knowledge that augment LLM agents at inference time. Despite rapid adoption, there is no standard way to measure whether they actually help. We present SkillsBench, a benchmark of 86 tasks across 11 domains paired with curated Skills and deterministic verifiers. Each task is evaluated under three conditions: no Skills, curated Skills, and self-generated Skills. We test 7 agent-model configurations over 7,308 trajectories. Curated Skills raise average pass rate by 16.2 percentage points(pp), but effects vary widely by domain (+4.5pp for Software Engineering to +51.9pp for Healthcare) and 16 of 84 tasks show negative deltas. Self-generated Skills provide no benefit on average, showing that models cannot reliably author the procedural knowledge they benefit from consuming. Focused Skills with 2--3 modules outperform comprehensive documentation, and smaller models with Skills can match larger models without them.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (new benchmark for embodied/agentic AI). Introduces SkillsBench, a benchmark for evaluating agent skills across diverse tasks, with analysis of skill effectiveness and agent performance.

## 7. [Beyond Benchmarks of IUGC: Rethinking Requirements of Deep Learning Methods for Intrapartum Ultrasound Biometry from Fetal Ultrasound Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12922) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.12922
**Authors:** Jieyun Bai, Zihao Zhou, Yitong Tang, Jie Gan, Zhuonan Liang, Jianan Fan, Lisa B. Mcguire, Jillian L.

Campello, Benard Ohene-Botwe, Isaac Khobo, Yuxin Huang, Zhenyan Han, Hongying Hou, Di Qiu, Zheng Zheng, Gongning Luo, Dong Ni, Yaosheng Lu, Karim Lekadir, Shuo Li

**Abstract:**  A substantial proportion (45\%) of maternal deaths, neonatal deaths, and stillbirths occur during the intrapartum phase, with a particularly high burden in low- and middle-income countries. Intrapartum biometry plays a critical role in monitoring labor progression; however, the routine use of ultrasound in resource-limited settings is hindered by a shortage of trained sonographers. To address this challenge, the Intrapartum Ultrasound Grand Challenge (IUGC), co-hosted with MICCAI 2024, was launched. The IUGC introduces a clinically oriented multi-task automatic measurement framework that integrates standard plane classification, fetal head-pubic symphysis segmentation, and biometry, enabling algorithms to exploit complementary task information for more accurate estimation. Furthermore, the challenge releases the largest multi-center intrapartum ultrasound video dataset to date, comprising 774 videos (68,106 frames) collected from three hospitals, providing a robust foundation for model training and evaluation. In this study, we present a comprehensive overview of the challenge design, review the submissions from eight participating teams, and analyze their methods from five perspectives: preprocessing, data augmentation, learning strategy, model architecture, and post-processing. In addition, we perform a systematic analysis of the benchmark results to identify key bottlenecks, explore potential solutions, and highlight open challenges for future research. Although encouraging performance has been achieved, our findings indicate that the field remains at an early stage, and further in-depth investigation is required before large-scale clinical deployment. All benchmark solutions and the complete dataset have been publicly released to facilitate reproducible research and promote continued advances in automatic intrapartum ultrasound biometry.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (Embodied AI papers on building new benchmark): Introduces a new large-scale multi-center intrapartum ultrasound video dataset and a multi-task benchmark for automatic biometry, with a comprehensive analysis of methods and open challenges. The focus on benchmarking and dataset release is a novel angle for embodied AI in medical imaging.

## 8. [DynaGuide: A Generalizable Dynamic Guidance Framework for Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13020) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.13020
**Authors:** Boujemaa Guermazi, Riadh Ksantini, Naimul Khan

**Abstract:**  Unsupervised image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision. It enables dense scene understanding without human annotations, which is especially valuable in domains where labelled data is scarce. However, existing methods often struggle to reconcile global semantic structure with fine-grained boundary accuracy. This paper introduces DynaGuide, an adaptive segmentation framework that addresses these challenges through a novel dual-guidance strategy and dynamic loss optimization. Building on our previous work, DynaSeg, DynaGuide combines global pseudo-labels from zero-shot models such as DiffSeg or SegFormer with local boundary refinement using a lightweight CNN trained from scratch. This synergy allows the model to correct coarse or noisy global predictions and produce high-precision segmentations. At the heart of DynaGuide is a multi-component loss that dynamically balances feature similarity, Huber-smoothed spatial continuity, including diagonal relationships, and semantic alignment with the global pseudo-labels. Unlike prior approaches, DynaGuide trains entirely without ground-truth labels in the target domain and supports plug-and-play integration of diverse guidance sources. Extensive experiments on BSD500, PASCAL VOC2012, and COCO demonstrate that DynaGuide achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving mIoU by 17.5% on BSD500, 3.1% on PASCAL VOC2012, and 11.66% on COCO. With its modular design, strong generalization, and minimal computational footprint, DynaGuide offers a scalable and practical solution for unsupervised segmentation in real-world settings. Code available at: https://github.com/RyersonMultimediaLab/DynaGuide

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications): Proposes DynaGuide, a generalizable unsupervised segmentation framework that leverages zero-shot models and dynamic loss optimization. The modular, plug-and-play design and strong empirical results make it relevant for vision foundation model applications.

## 9. [Semantic-aware Adversarial Fine-tuning for CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12461) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.12461
**Authors:** Jiacheng Zhang, Jinhao Li, Hanxun Huang, Sarah M. Erfani, Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein, Feng Liu

**Abstract:**  Recent studies have shown that CLIP model's adversarial robustness in zero-shot classification tasks can be enhanced by adversarially fine-tuning its image encoder with adversarial examples (AEs), which are generated by minimizing the cosine similarity between images and a hand-crafted template (e.g., ''A photo of a {label}''). However, it has been shown that the cosine similarity between a single image and a single hand-crafted template is insufficient to measure the similarity for image-text pairs. Building on this, in this paper, we find that the AEs generated using cosine similarity may fail to fool CLIP when the similarity metric is replaced with semantically enriched alternatives, making the image encoder fine-tuned with these AEs less robust. To overcome this issue, we first propose a semantic-ensemble attack to generate semantic-aware AEs by minimizing the average similarity between the original image and an ensemble of refined textual descriptions. These descriptions are initially generated by a foundation model to capture core semantic features beyond hand-crafted templates and are then refined to reduce hallucinations. To this end, we propose Semantic-aware Adversarial Fine-Tuning (SAFT), which fine-tunes CLIP's image encoder with semantic-aware AEs. Extensive experiments show that SAFT outperforms current methods, achieving substantial improvements in zero-shot adversarial robustness across 16 datasets. Our code is available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/SAFT.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a new adversarial fine-tuning method for CLIP, a vision-language foundation model, to improve adversarial robustness. This matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) and is also relevant to your friend's interest in clever statistical tricks and empirical results.

## 10. [ZeroDiff++: Substantial Unseen Visual-semantic Correlation in Zero-shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12401) <a id="link10"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.12401
**Authors:** Zihan Ye, Shreyank N Gowda, Kaile Du, Weijian Luo, Ling Shao

**Abstract:**  Zero-shot Learning (ZSL) enables classifiers to recognize classes unseen during training, commonly via generative two stage methods: (1) learn visual semantic correlations from seen classes; (2) synthesize unseen class features from semantics to train classifiers. In this paper, we identify spurious visual semantic correlations in existing generative ZSL worsened by scarce seen class samples and introduce two metrics to quantify spuriousness for seen and unseen classes. Furthermore, we point out a more critical bottleneck: existing unadaptive fully noised generators produce features disconnected from real test samples, which also leads to the spurious correlation. To enhance the visual-semantic correlations on both seen and unseen classes, we propose ZeroDiff++, a diffusion-based generative framework. In training, ZeroDiff++ uses (i) diffusion augmentation to produce diverse noised samples, (ii) supervised contrastive (SC) representations for instance level semantics, and (iii) multi view discriminators with Wasserstein mutual learning to assess generated features. At generation time, we introduce (iv) Diffusion-based Test time Adaptation (DiffTTA) to adapt the generator using pseudo label reconstruction, and (v) Diffusion-based Test time Generation (DiffGen) to trace the diffusion denoising path and produce partially synthesized features that connect real and generated data, and mitigates data scarcity further. Extensive experiments on three ZSL benchmarks demonstrate that ZeroDiff++ not only achieves significant improvements over existing ZSL methods but also maintains robust performance even with scarce training data. Code would be available.

**Comment:** This paper proposes ZeroDiff++, a diffusion-based generative framework for zero-shot learning, focusing on improving visual-semantic correlations. It is relevant to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) due to its use of diffusion models for vision tasks and generative modeling in multi-modal learning.

## 11. [Training-Free Acceleration for Document Parsing Vision-Language Model with Hierarchical Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12957) <a id="link11"></a>

**Abstract:**  Document parsing is a fundamental task in multimodal understanding, supporting a wide range of downstream applications such as information extraction and intelligent document analysis. Benefiting from strong semantic modeling and robust generalization, VLM-based end-to-end approaches have emerged as the mainstream paradigm in recent years. However, these models often suffer from substantial inference latency, as they must auto-regressively generate long token sequences when processing long-form documents. In this work, motivated by the extremely long outputs and complex layout structures commonly found in document parsing, we propose a training-free and highly efficient acceleration method. Inspired by speculative decoding, we employ a lightweight document parsing pipeline as a draft model to predict batches of future tokens, while the more accurate VLM verifies these draft predictions in parallel. Moreover, we further exploit the layout-structured nature of documents by partitioning each page into independent regions, enabling parallel decoding of each region using the same draft-verify strategy. The final predictions are then assembled according to the natural reading order. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: on the general-purpose OmniDocBench, our method provides a 2.42x lossless acceleration for the dots.ocr model, and achieves up to 4.89x acceleration on long-document parsing tasks. We will release our code to facilitate reproducibility and future research.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a training-free acceleration method for document parsing vision-language models using hierarchical speculative decoding. It is relevant to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications), especially in efficient inference for VLMs.

## 12. [IndicFairFace: Balanced Indian Face Dataset for Auditing and Mitigating Geographical Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12659) <a id="link12"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.12659
**Authors:** Aarish Shah Mohsin, Mohammed Tayyab Ilyas Khan, Mohammad Nadeem, Shahab Saquib Sohail, Erik Cambria, Jiechao Gao

**Abstract:**  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are known to inherit and amplify societal biases from their web-scale training data with Indian being particularly misrepresented. Existing fairness-aware datasets have significantly improved demographic balance across global race and gender groups, yet they continue to treat Indian as a single monolithic category. The oversimplification ignores the vast intra-national diversity across 28 states and 8 Union Territories of India and leads to representational and geographical bias. To address the limitation, we present IndicFairFace, a novel and balanced face dataset comprising 14,400 images representing geographical diversity of India. Images were sourced ethically from Wikimedia Commons and open-license web repositories and uniformly balanced across states and gender. Using IndicFairFace, we quantify intra-national geographical bias in prominent CLIP-based VLMs and reduce it using post-hoc Iterative Nullspace Projection debiasing approach. We also show that the adopted debiasing approach does not adversely impact the existing embedding space as the average drop in retrieval accuracy on benchmark datasets is less than 1.5 percent. Our work establishes IndicFairFace as the first benchmark to study geographical bias in VLMs for the Indian context.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (VLMs) and criterion 4 (benchmark for vision foundation models). Introduces a new dataset (IndicFairFace) for auditing and mitigating geographical bias in vision-language models, specifically CLIP-based VLMs, and proposes a debiasing method.

## 13. [Multimodal Classification via Total Correlation Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13015) <a id="link13"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.13015
**Authors:** Feng Yu, Xiangyu Wu, Yang Yang, Jianfeng Lu

**Abstract:**  Multimodal learning integrates data from diverse sensors to effectively harness information from different modalities. However, recent studies reveal that joint learning often overfits certain modalities while neglecting others, leading to performance inferior to that of unimodal learning. Although previous efforts have sought to balance modal contributions or combine joint and unimodal learning, thereby mitigating the degradation of weaker modalities with promising outcomes, few have examined the relationship between joint and unimodal learning from an information-theoretic perspective. In this paper, we theoretically analyze modality competition and propose a method for multimodal classification by maximizing the total correlation between multimodal features and labels. By maximizing this objective, our approach alleviates modality competition while capturing inter-modal interactions via feature alignment. Building on Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE), we introduce Total Correlation Neural Estimation (TCNE) to derive a lower bound for total correlation. Subsequently, we present TCMax, a hyperparameter-free loss function that maximizes total correlation through variational bound optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCMax outperforms state-of-the-art joint and unimodal learning approaches. Our code is available at https://github.com/hubaak/TCMax.

## 14. [Curriculum-DPO++: Direct Preference Optimization via Data and Model Curricula for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13055) <a id="link14"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.13055
**Authors:** Florinel-Alin Croitoru, Vlad Hondru, Radu Tudor Ionescu, Nicu Sebe, Mubarak Shah

**Abstract:**  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an effective and efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, neither RLHF nor DPO take into account the fact that learning certain preferences is more difficult than learning other preferences, rendering the optimization process suboptimal. To address this gap in text-to-image generation, we recently proposed Curriculum-DPO, a method that organizes image pairs by difficulty. In this paper, we introduce Curriculum-DPO++, an enhanced method that combines the original data-level curriculum with a novel model-level curriculum. More precisely, we propose to dynamically increase the learning capacity of the denoising network as training advances. We implement this capacity increase via two mechanisms. First, we initialize the model with only a subset of the trainable layers used in the original Curriculum-DPO. As training progresses, we sequentially unfreeze layers until the configuration matches the full baseline architecture. Second, as the fine-tuning is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we implement a progressive schedule for the dimension of the low-rank matrices. Instead of maintaining a fixed capacity, we initialize the low-rank matrices with a dimension significantly smaller than that of the baseline. As training proceeds, we incrementally increase their rank, allowing the capacity to grow until it converges to the same rank value as in Curriculum-DPO. Furthermore, we propose an alternative ranking strategy to the one employed by Curriculum-DPO. Finally, we compare Curriculum-DPO++ against Curriculum-DPO and other state-of-the-art preference optimization approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference. Our code is available at https://github.com/CroitoruAlin/Curriculum-DPO.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Proposes a new curriculum-based method for preference optimization in text-to-image generation, improving on DPO and RLHF.

## 15. [LiDAR-Anchored Collaborative Distillation for Robust 2D Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12524) <a id="link15"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.12524
**Authors:** Wonjun Jo, Hyunwoo Ha, Kim Ji-Yeon, Hawook Jeong, Tae-Hyun Oh

**Abstract:**  As deep learning continues to advance, self-supervised learning has made considerable strides. It allows 2D image encoders to extract useful features for various downstream tasks, including those related to vision-based systems. Nevertheless, pre-trained 2D image encoders fall short in conducting the task under noisy and adverse weather conditions beyond clear daytime scenes, which require for robust visual perception. To address these issues, we propose a novel self-supervised approach, \textbf{Collaborative Distillation}, which leverages 3D LiDAR as self-supervision to improve robustness to noisy and adverse weather conditions in 2D image encoders while retaining their original capabilities. Our method outperforms competing methods in various downstream tasks across diverse conditions and exhibits strong generalization ability. In addition, our method also improves 3D awareness stemming from LiDAR's characteristics. This advancement highlights our method's practicality and adaptability in real-world scenarios.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a self-supervised approach using LiDAR as supervision to improve robustness of 2D image encoders. It is relevant to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications), as it enhances vision models for real-world scenarios, and also touches on multi-modal learning.

## 16. [Adaptive Scaling with Geometric and Visual Continuity of completed 3D objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12905) <a id="link16"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.12905
**Authors:** Jelle Vermandere, Maarten Bassier, Maarten Vergauwen

**Abstract:**  Object completion networks typically produce static Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) that faithfully reconstruct geometry but cannot be rescaled or deformed without introducing structural distortions. This limitation restricts their use in applications requiring flexible object manipulation, such as indoor redesign, simulation, and digital content creation. We introduce a part-aware scaling framework that transforms these static completed SDFs into editable, structurally coherent objects. Starting from SDFs and Texture Fields generated by state-of-the-art completion models, our method performs automatic part segmentation, defines user-controlled scaling zones, and applies smooth interpolation of SDFs, color, and part indices to enable proportional and artifact-free deformation. We further incorporate a repetition-based strategy to handle large-scale deformations while preserving repeating geometric patterns. Experiments on Matterport3D and ShapeNet objects show that our method overcomes the inherent rigidity of completed SDFs and is visually more appealing than global and naive selective scaling, particularly for complex shapes and repetitive structures.

**Comment:** Somewhat relevant to spatial understanding (criterion 1), as it deals with 3D object completion and manipulation, but not in the context of embodied agents. No VLLM/MLLM or embodied AI focus.

**Authors:** Junjie Wang, Zequn Xie, Dan Yang, Jie Feng, Yue Shen, Duolin Sun, Meixiu Long, Yihan Jiao, Zhehao Tan, Jian Wang, Peng Wei, Jinjie Gu

**Abstract:**  Deep Research systems based on web agents have shown strong potential in solving complex information-seeking tasks, yet their search efficiency remains underexplored. We observe that many state-of-the-art open-source web agents rely on long tool-call trajectories with cyclic reasoning loops and exploration of unproductive branches. To address this, we propose WebClipper, a framework that compresses web agent trajectories via graph-based pruning. Concretely, we model the agent's search process as a state graph and cast trajectory optimization as a minimum-necessary Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) mining problem, yielding pruned trajectories that preserve essential reasoning while eliminating redundant steps. Continued training on these refined trajectories enables the agent to evolve toward more efficient search patterns and reduces tool-call rounds by about 20% while improving accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric called F-AE Score to measure the model's overall performance in balancing accuracy and efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that WebClipper compresses tool-call rounds under excellent performance, providing practical insight into balancing effectiveness and efficiency in web agent design.

**Comment:** This paper introduces WebClipper, a framework for efficient web agent evolution via graph-based trajectory pruning. While it is a methodological improvement for web agents, it does not focus on spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

## 18. [Universal Transformation of One-Class Classifiers for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13091) <a id="link18"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.13091
**Authors:** Declan McIntosh, Alexandra Branzan Albu

**Abstract:**  Detecting anomalies in images and video is an essential task for multiple real-world problems, including industrial inspection, computer-assisted diagnosis, and environmental monitoring. Anomaly detection is typically formulated as a one-class classification problem, where the training data consists solely of nominal values, leaving methods built on this assumption susceptible to training label noise. We present a dataset folding method that transforms an arbitrary one-class classifier-based anomaly detector into a fully unsupervised method. This is achieved by making a set of key weak assumptions: that anomalies are uncommon in the training dataset and generally heterogeneous. These assumptions enable us to utilize multiple independently trained instances of a one-class classifier to filter the training dataset for anomalies. This transformation requires no modifications to the underlying anomaly detector; the only changes are algorithmically selected data subsets used for training. We demonstrate that our method can transform a wide variety of one-class classifier anomaly detectors for both images and videos into unsupervised ones. Our method creates the first unsupervised logical anomaly detectors by transforming existing methods. We also demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised anomaly detection on the MVTec AD, ViSA, and MVTec Loco AD datasets. As improvements to one-class classifiers are made, our method directly transfers those improvements to the unsupervised domain, linking the domains.

**Comment:** This paper presents a method to transform one-class classifier-based anomaly detectors into fully unsupervised methods. While it is a methodological improvement in anomaly detection, it does not match any of the four criteria.

## 19. [Think Fast and Slow: Step-Level Cognitive Depth Adaptation for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12662) <a id="link19"></a>

**Authors:** Ruihan Yang, Fanghua Ye, Xiang We, Ruoqing Zhao, Kang Luo, Xinbo Xu, Bo Zhao, Ruotian Ma, Shanyi Wang, Zhaopeng Tu, Xiaolong Li, Deqing Yang, Linus

**Abstract:**  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents for multi-turn decision-making tasks. However, current agents typically rely on fixed cognitive patterns: non-thinking models generate immediate responses, while thinking models engage in deep reasoning uniformly. This rigidity is inefficient for long-horizon tasks, where cognitive demands vary significantly from step to step, with some requiring strategic planning and others only routine execution. In this paper, we introduce CogRouter, a framework that trains agents to dynamically adapt cognitive depth at each step. Grounded in ACT-R theory, we design four hierarchical cognitive levels ranging from instinctive responses to strategic planning. Our two-stage training approach includes Cognition-aware Supervised Fine-tuning (CoSFT) to instill stable level-specific patterns, and Cognition-aware Policy Optimization (CoPO) for step-level credit assignment via confidence-aware advantage reweighting. The key insight is that appropriate cognitive depth should maximize the confidence of the resulting action. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld demonstrate that CogRouter achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior efficiency. With Qwen2.5-7B, it reaches an 82.3% success rate, outperforming GPT-4o (+40.3%), OpenAI-o3 (+18.3%), and GRPO (+14.0%), while using 62% fewer tokens.

**Comment:** This paper proposes CogRouter, a framework for dynamically adapting cognitive depth in LLM agents for decision-making tasks, evaluated on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld. While it is related to embodied agents and LLMs, it does not focus on spatial intelligence or vision/multimodal models, so it does not directly match any criterion.

## 20. [Detecting Object Tracking Failure via Sequential Hypothesis Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12983) <a id="link20"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.12983
**Authors:** Alejandro Monroy Mu\~noz, Rajeev Verma, Alexander Timans

**Abstract:**  Real-time online object tracking in videos constitutes a core task in computer vision, with wide-ranging applications including video surveillance, motion capture, and robotics. Deployed tracking systems usually lack formal safety assurances to convey when tracking is reliable and when it may fail, at best relying on heuristic measures of model confidence to raise alerts. To obtain such assurances we propose interpreting object tracking as a sequential hypothesis test, wherein evidence for or against tracking failures is gradually accumulated over time. Leveraging recent advancements in the field, our sequential test (formalized as an e-process) quickly identifies when tracking failures set in whilst provably containing false alerts at a desired rate, and thus limiting potentially costly re-calibration or intervention steps. The approach is computationally light-weight, requires no extra training or fine-tuning, and is in principle model-agnostic. We propose both supervised and unsupervised variants by leveraging either ground-truth or solely internal tracking information, and demonstrate its effectiveness for two established tracking models across four video benchmarks. As such, sequential testing can offer a statistically grounded and efficient mechanism to incorporate safety assurances into real-time tracking systems.

**Comment:** This paper introduces a statistically grounded method for detecting object tracking failure using sequential hypothesis testing. While it is a clever statistical trick in computer vision, it does not directly address any of the four criteria.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.13067
**Authors:** Chunming Li, Shidong Wang, Tong Xin, Haofeng Zhang

**Abstract:**  This paper presents a novel approach, Spectral-Interpretable and -Enhanced Transformer (SIEFormer), which leverages spectral analysis to reinterpret the attention mechanism within Vision Transformer (ViT) and enhance feature adaptability, with particular emphasis on challenging Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) tasks. The proposed SIEFormer is composed of two main branches, each corresponding to an implicit and explicit spectral perspective of the ViT, enabling joint optimization. The implicit branch realizes the use of different types of graph Laplacians to model the local structure correlations of tokens, along with a novel Band-adaptive Filter (BaF) layer that can flexibly perform both band-pass and band-reject filtering. The explicit branch, on the other hand, introduces a Maneuverable Filtering Layer (MFL) that learns global dependencies among tokens by applying the Fourier transform to the input ``value" features, modulating the transformed signal with a set of learnable parameters in the frequency domain, and then performing an inverse Fourier transform to obtain the enhanced features. Extensive experiments reveal state-of-the-art performance on multiple image recognition datasets, reaffirming the superiority of our approach through ablation studies and visualizations.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a new transformer architecture (SIEFormer) for vision tasks, leveraging spectral analysis for improved feature adaptability. While it is a methodological improvement in vision transformers, it does not directly address spatial intelligence in embodied agents (criterion 1), VLLMs/MLLMs (criterion 2), embodied AI benchmarks (criterion 3), or vision foundation models (criterion 4).

## 22. [Realistic Face Reconstruction from Facial Embeddings via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13168) <a id="link22"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.13168
**Authors:** Dong Han, Yong Li, Joachim Denzler

**Abstract:**  With the advancement of face recognition (FR) systems, privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) systems have gained popularity for their accurate recognition, enhanced facial privacy protection, and robustness to various attacks. However, there are limited studies to further verify privacy risks by reconstructing realistic high-resolution face images from embeddings of these systems, especially for PPFR. In this work, we propose the face embedding mapping (FEM), a general framework that explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for conducting the embedding-to-face attack by leveraging pre-trained Identity-Preserving diffusion model against state-of-the-art (SOTA) FR and PPFR systems. Based on extensive experiments, we verify that reconstructed faces can be used for accessing other real-word FR systems. Besides, the proposed method shows the robustness in reconstructing faces from the partial and protected face embeddings. Moreover, FEM can be utilized as a tool for evaluating safety of FR and PPFR systems in terms of privacy leakage. All images used in this work are from public datasets.

**Comment:** This paper does not directly match any of the four criteria. It focuses on reconstructing faces from embeddings using diffusion models, which is related to generative modeling and privacy in face recognition, but not specifically to spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI benchmarks, or vision foundation models and their applications.

## 23. [Motion Prior Distillation in Time Reversal Sampling for Generative Inbetweening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12679) <a id="link23"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.12679
**Authors:** Wooseok Jeon, Seunghyun Shin, Dongmin Shin, Hae-Gon Jeon

**Abstract:**  Recent progress in image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models has significantly advanced the field of generative inbetweening, which aims to generate semantically plausible frames between two keyframes. In particular, inference-time sampling strategies, which leverage the generative priors of large-scale pre-trained I2V models without additional training, have become increasingly popular. However, existing inference-time sampling, either fusing forward and backward paths in parallel or alternating them sequentially, often suffers from temporal discontinuities and undesirable visual artifacts due to the misalignment between the two generated paths. This is because each path follows the motion prior induced by its own conditioning frame. In this work, we propose Motion Prior Distillation (MPD), a simple yet effective inference-time distillation technique that suppresses bidirectional mismatch by distilling the motion residual of the forward path into the backward path. Our method can deliberately avoid denoising the end-conditioned path which causes the ambiguity of the path, and yield more temporally coherent inbetweening results with the forward motion prior. We not only perform quantitative evaluations on standard benchmarks, but also conduct extensive user studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in practical scenarios.

**Authors:** Yubo Li, Ramayya Krishnan, Rema Padman

**Abstract:**  Large reasoning models with reasoning capabilities achieve state-of-the-art performance on complex tasks, but their robustness under multi-turn adversarial pressure remains underexplored. We evaluate nine frontier reasoning models under adversarial attacks. Our findings reveal that reasoning confers meaningful but incomplete robustness: most reasoning models studied significantly outperform instruction-tuned baselines, yet all exhibit distinct vulnerability profiles, with misleading suggestions universally effective and social pressure showing model-specific efficacy. Through trajectory analysis, we identify five failure modes (Self-Doubt, Social Conformity, Suggestion Hijacking, Emotional Susceptibility, and Reasoning Fatigue) with the first two accounting for 50% of failures. We further demonstrate that Confidence-Aware Response Generation (CARG), effective for standard LLMs, fails for reasoning models due to overconfidence induced by extended reasoning traces; counterintuitively, random confidence embedding outperforms targeted extraction. Our results highlight that reasoning capabilities do not automatically confer adversarial robustness and that confidence-based defenses require fundamental redesign for reasoning models.

**Authors:** Na\"im Es-sebbani, Esteban Marquer, Yakoub Salhi, Zied Bouraoui

**Abstract:**  Logic provides a controlled testbed for evaluating LLM-based reasoners, yet standard SAT-style benchmarks often conflate surface difficulty (length, wording, clause order) with the structural phenomena that actually determine satisfiability. We introduce a diagnostic benchmark for 2-SAT built from parameterized families of structured 2--CNF formulas, where satisfiability is characterized by the implication graph and can be tuned along interpretable axes. Our generators isolate distinct competencies and failure modes: (i) contradiction-cycle UNSAT cores with controllable size and imbalance, (ii) SAT instances with a prescribed fraction of free variables to control solution multiplicity, (iii) planted backbones that modulate propagation, (iv) late bridge clauses that couple otherwise monotone regions to probe sensitivity to ordering and revision, and (v) symmetry/duplication variants that test abstraction under renaming and redundant structure. We evaluate LLM-based reasoners on decision accuracy and assignment validity, and quantify robustness under semantics-preserving perturbations such as clause reordering, filler clauses, and variable renaming. Across models, we observe sharp performance transitions under targeted structural interventions even when surface statistics are held fixed, revealing brittleness regimes that are invisible to aggregate SAT accuracy.

**Comment:** This paper introduces a new diagnostic benchmark for evaluating LLM-based reasoners on parameterized logical problems. While it is a methodological improvement in reasoning evaluation, it does not focus on spatial understanding, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied agents, or vision foundation models. It is more about logical reasoning and robustness.

**Authors:** Dimitrios Karamatskos, Vasileios Arampatzakis, Vasileios Sevetlidis, Stavros Nousias, Athanasios Kalogeras, Christos Koulamas, Aris Lalos, George Pavlidis

**Abstract:**  Archaeologists, as well as specialists and practitioners in cultural heritage, require applications with additional functions, such as the annotation and attachment of metadata to specific regions of the 3D digital artifacts, to go beyond the simplistic three-dimensional (3D) visualization. Different strategies addressed this issue, most of which are excellent in their particular area of application, but their capacity is limited to their design's purpose; they lack generalization and interoperability. This paper introduces ART3mis, a general-purpose, user-friendly, feature-rich, interactive web-based textual annotation tool for 3D objects. Moreover, it enables the communication, distribution, and reuse of information as it complies with the W3C Web Annotation Data Model. It is primarily designed to help cultural heritage conservators, restorers, and curators who lack technical expertise in 3D imaging and graphics, handle, segment, and annotate 3D digital replicas of artifacts with ease.

**Abstract:**  Beyond simplistic 3D visualisations, archaeologists, as well as cultural heritage experts and practitioners, need applications with advanced functionalities. Such as the annotation and attachment of metadata onto particular regions of the 3D digital objects. Various approaches have been presented to tackle this challenge, most of which achieve excellent results in the domain of their application. However, they are often confined to that specific domain and particular problem. In this paper, we present ART3mis - a general-purpose, user-friendly, interactive textual annotation tool for 3D objects. Primarily attuned to aid cultural heritage conservators, restorers and curators with no technical skills in 3D imaging and graphics, the tool allows for the easy handling, segmenting and annotating of 3D digital replicas of artefacts. ART3mis applies a user-driven, direct-on-surface approach. It can handle detailed 3D cultural objects in real-time and store textual annotations for multiple complex regions in JSON data format.

**Comment:** Presents a tool for annotating 3D cultural objects. While it involves 3D vision, it does not introduce new methods for spatial intelligence in embodied agents, VLLMs/MLLMs, or vision foundation models. It is more of a domain-specific application.

**Authors:** Seth Donahue, J. D. Peiffer, R. Tyler Richardson, Yishan Zhong, Shaun Q. Y. Tan, Benoit Marteau, Stephanie R. Russo, May D. Wang, R. James Cotton, Ross Chafetz

**Abstract:**  To validate a clinically accessible approach for quantifying the Upper Extremity Reachable Workspace (UERW) using a single (monocular) camera and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven Markerless Motion Capture (MMC) for biomechanical analysis. Objective assessment and validation of these techniques for specific clinically oriented tasks are crucial for their adoption in clinical motion analysis. AI-driven monocular MMC reduces the barriers to adoption in the clinic and has the potential to reduce the overhead for analysis of this common clinical assessment. Nine adult participants with no impairments performed the standardized UERW task, which entails reaching targets distributed across a virtual sphere centered on the torso, with targets displayed in a VR headset. Movements were simultaneously captured using a marker-based motion capture system and a set of eight FLIR cameras. We performed monocular video analysis on two of these video camera views to compare a frontal and offset camera configurations. The frontal camera orientation demonstrated strong agreement with the marker-based reference, exhibiting a minimal mean bias of $0.61 \pm 0.12$ \% reachspace reached per octanct (mean $\pm$ standard deviation). In contrast, the offset camera view underestimated the percent workspace reached ($-5.66 \pm 0.45$ \% reachspace reached). Conclusion: The findings support the feasibility of a frontal monocular camera configuration for UERW assessment, particularly for anterior workspace evaluation where agreement with marker-based motion capture was highest. The overall performance demonstrates clinical potential for practical, single-camera assessments. This study provides the first validation of monocular MMC system for the assessment of the UERW task. By reducing technical complexity, this approach enables broader implementation of quantitative upper extremity mobility assessment.

**Comment:** This paper presents a monocular markerless motion capture system for upper extremity workspace assessment. While it is a methodological improvement in motion capture, it does not focus on spatial intelligence for embodied agents, VLLMs/MLLMs, or vision foundation models. It is more of a clinical application.
**Relevance:** 3
**Novelty:** 4
