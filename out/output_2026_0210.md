## 0. [Demo-ICL: In-Context Learning for Procedural Video Knowledge Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08439) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.08439
**Authors:** Yuhao Dong, Shulin Tian, Shuai Liu, Shuangrui Ding, Yuhang Zang, Xiaoyi Dong, Yuhang Cao, Jiaqi Wang, Ziwei Liu

**Abstract:**  Despite the growing video understanding capabilities of recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), existing video benchmarks primarily assess understanding based on models' static, internal knowledge, rather than their ability to learn and adapt from dynamic, novel contexts from few examples. To bridge this gap, we present Demo-driven Video In-Context Learning, a novel task focused on learning from in-context demonstrations to answer questions about the target videos. Alongside this, we propose Demo-ICL-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate demo-driven video in-context learning capabilities. Demo-ICL-Bench is constructed from 1200 instructional YouTube videos with associated questions, from which two types of demonstrations are derived: (i) summarizing video subtitles for text demonstration; and (ii) corresponding instructional videos as video demonstrations. To effectively tackle this new challenge, we develop Demo-ICL, an MLLM with a two-stage training strategy: video-supervised fine-tuning and information-assisted direct preference optimization, jointly enhancing the model's ability to learn from in-context examples. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs confirm the difficulty of Demo-ICL-Bench, demonstrate the effectiveness of Demo-ICL, and thereby unveil future research directions.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 (new MLLMs) and 3 (new embodied AI benchmark). Introduces Demo-ICL, a new MLLM for video in-context learning, and Demo-ICL-Bench, a new benchmark for procedural video knowledge acquisition, focusing on in-context learning from demonstrations—a novel angle for video understanding.

## 1. [OneVision-Encoder: Codec-Aligned Sparsity as a Foundational Principle for Multimodal Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08683) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.08683
**Authors:** Feilong Tang, Xiang An, Yunyao Yan, Yin Xie, Bin Qin, Kaicheng Yang, Yifei Shen, Yuanhan Zhang, Chunyuan Li, Shikun Feng, Changrui Chen, Huajie Tan, Ming Hu, Manyuan Zhang, Bo Li, Ziyong Feng, Ziwei Liu, Zongyuan Ge, Jiankang Deng

**Abstract:**  Hypothesis. Artificial general intelligence is, at its core, a compression problem. Effective compression demands resonance: deep learning scales best when its architecture aligns with the fundamental structure of the data. These are the fundamental principles. Yet, modern vision architectures have strayed from these truths: visual signals are highly redundant, while discriminative information, the surprise, is sparse. Current models process dense pixel grids uniformly, wasting vast compute on static background rather than focusing on the predictive residuals that define motion and meaning. We argue that to solve visual understanding, we must align our architectures with the information-theoretic principles of video, i.e., Codecs.   Method. OneVision-Encoder encodes video by compressing predictive visual structure into semantic meaning. By adopting Codec Patchification, OV-Encoder abandons uniform computation to focus exclusively on the 3.1%-25% of regions rich in signal entropy. To unify spatial and temporal reasoning under irregular token layouts, OneVision-Encoder employs a shared 3D RoPE and is trained with a large-scale cluster discrimination objective over more than one million semantic concepts, jointly capturing object permanence and motion dynamics.   Evidence. The results validate our core hypothesis: efficiency and accuracy are not a trade-off; they are positively correlated. When integrated into LLM, it consistently outperforms strong vision backbones such as Qwen3-ViT and SigLIP2 across 16 image, video, and document understanding benchmarks, despite using substantially fewer visual tokens and pretraining data. Notably, on video understanding tasks, OV-Encoder achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over Qwen3-ViT. Codec-aligned, patch-level sparsity is a foundational principle, enabling OV-Encoder as a scalable engine for next-generation visual generalists.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 (new VLLMs/MLLMs) and 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Proposes a new vision encoder (OneVision-Encoder) with codec-aligned sparsity, showing strong empirical results and a novel information-theoretic approach to visual token selection. Also discusses integration with LLMs and outperforms strong vision backbones.

## 2. [When and How Much to Imagine: Adaptive Test-Time Scaling with World Models for Visual Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08236) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.08236
**Authors:** Shoubin Yu, Yue Zhang, Zun Wang, Jaehong Yoon, Huaxiu Yao, Mingyu Ding, Mohit Bansal

**Abstract:**  Despite rapid progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), visual spatial reasoning remains unreliable when correct answers depend on how a scene would appear under unseen or alternative viewpoints. Recent work addresses this by augmenting reasoning with world models for visual imagination, but questions such as when imagination is actually necessary, how much of it is beneficial, and when it becomes harmful, remain poorly understood. In practice, indiscriminate imagination can increase computation and even degrade performance by introducing misleading evidence. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of test-time visual imagination as a controllable resource for spatial reasoning. We study when static visual evidence is sufficient, when imagination improves reasoning, and how excessive or unnecessary imagination affects accuracy and efficiency. To support this analysis, we introduce AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework with world models that explicitly reasons about the sufficiency of current visual evidence before selectively invoking and scaling visual imagination. Across spatial reasoning benchmarks (SAT, MMSI) and an embodied navigation benchmark (R2R), our results reveal clear scenarios where imagination is critical, marginal, or detrimental, and show that selective control can match or outperform fixed imagination strategies with substantially fewer world-model calls and language tokens. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of analyzing and controlling test-time imagination for efficient and reliable spatial reasoning.

**Comment:** Directly matches criterion 1 (new methodological improvements to spatial understanding/spatial intelligence on embodied agents) and criterion 3 (embodied AI, new methods for spatial reasoning and navigation). The paper introduces AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework for visual imagination in spatial reasoning, and provides empirical insights into when and how much imagination is beneficial, including on embodied navigation benchmarks.

## 3. [WorldArena: A Unified Benchmark for Evaluating Perception and Functional Utility of Embodied World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08971) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.08971
**Authors:** Yu Shang, Zhuohang Li, Yiding Ma, Weikang Su, Xin Jin, Ziyou Wang, Xin Zhang, Yinzhou Tang, Chen Gao, Wei Wu, Xihui Liu, Dhruv Shah, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Zhibo Chen, Jun Zhu, Yonghong Tian, Tat-Seng Chua, Wenwu Zhu, Yong Li

**Abstract:**  While world models have emerged as a cornerstone of embodied intelligence by enabling agents to reason about environmental dynamics through action-conditioned prediction, their evaluation remains fragmented. Current evaluation of embodied world models has largely focused on perceptual fidelity (e.g., video generation quality), overlooking the functional utility of these models in downstream decision-making tasks. In this work, we introduce WorldArena, a unified benchmark designed to systematically evaluate embodied world models across both perceptual and functional dimensions. WorldArena assesses models through three dimensions: video perception quality, measured with 16 metrics across six sub-dimensions; embodied task functionality, which evaluates world models as data engines, policy evaluators, and action planners integrating with subjective human evaluation. Furthermore, we propose EWMScore, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional performance into a single interpretable index. Through extensive experiments on 14 representative models, we reveal a significant perception-functionality gap, showing that high visual quality does not necessarily translate into strong embodied task capability. WorldArena benchmark with the public leaderboard is released at https://worldarena.ai, providing a framework for tracking progress toward truly functional world models in embodied AI.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3: Introduces WorldArena, a unified benchmark for evaluating embodied world models on both perception and functional utility, and proposes a new holistic metric (EWMScore). This is a new benchmark for embodied AI with a novel evaluation angle.

## 4. [UNIKIE-BENCH: Benchmarking Large Multimodal Models for Key Information Extraction in Visual Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07038) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.07038
**Authors:** Yifan Ji, Zhipeng Xu, Zhenghao Liu, Zulong Chen, Qian Zhang, Zhibo Yang, Junyang Lin, Yu Gu, Ge Yu, Maosong Sun

**Abstract:**  Key Information Extraction (KIE) from real-world documents remains challenging due to substantial variations in layout structures, visual quality, and task-specific information requirements. Recent Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promising potential for performing end-to-end KIE directly from document images. To enable a comprehensive and systematic evaluation across realistic and diverse application scenarios, we introduce UNIKIE-BENCH, a unified benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the KIE capabilities of LMMs. UNIKIE-BENCH consists of two complementary tracks: a constrained-category KIE track with scenario-predefined schemas that reflect practical application needs, and an open-category KIE track that extracts any key information that is explicitly present in the document. Experiments on 15 state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial performance degradation under diverse schema definitions, long-tail key fields, and complex layouts, along with pronounced performance disparities across different document types and scenarios. These findings underscore persistent challenges in grounding accuracy and layout-aware reasoning for LMM-based KIE. All codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/UNIKIE-BENCH.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 and 3: This paper introduces UNIKIE-BENCH, a new benchmark for evaluating large multimodal models (LMMs) on key information extraction from visual documents. It provides a systematic evaluation of VLLMs/MLLMs and highlights their limitations in layout-aware reasoning, which is a novel angle for benchmarking. It is highly relevant for vision-language models and benchmarking in embodied AI.

## 5. [E-VAds: An E-commerce Short Videos Understanding Benchmark for MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08355) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.08355
**Authors:** Xianjie Liu, Yiman Hu, Liang Wu, Ping Hu, Yixiong Zou, Jian Xu, Bo Zheng

**Abstract:**  E-commerce short videos represent a high-revenue segment of the online video industry characterized by a goal-driven format and dense multi-modal signals. Current models often struggle with these videos because existing benchmarks focus primarily on general-purpose tasks and neglect the reasoning of commercial intent. In this work, we first propose a \textbf{multi-modal information density assessment framework} to quantify the complexity of this domain. Our evaluation reveals that e-commerce content exhibits substantially higher density across visual, audio, and textual modalities compared to mainstream datasets, establishing a more challenging frontier for video understanding. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{E-commerce Video Ads Benchmark (E-VAds)}, which is the first benchmark specifically designed for e-commerce short video understanding. We curated 3,961 high-quality videos from Taobao covering a wide range of product categories and used a multi-agent system to generate 19,785 open-ended Q&A pairs. These questions are organized into two primary dimensions, namely Perception and Cognition and Reasoning, which consist of five distinct tasks. Finally, we develop \textbf{E-VAds-R1}, an RL-based reasoning model featuring a multi-grained reward design called \textbf{MG-GRPO}. This strategy provides smooth guidance for early exploration while creating a non-linear incentive for expert-level precision. Experimental results demonstrate that E-VAds-R1 achieves a 109.2% performance gain in commercial intent reasoning with only a few hundred training samples.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 and 2: Introduces a new benchmark (E-VAds) for multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) focused on e-commerce short video understanding, with a novel multi-modal information density assessment and RL-based reasoning model. This is a new benchmark and method for MLLMs in a challenging domain.

## 6. [TimeChat-Captioner: Scripting Multi-Scene Videos with Time-Aware and Structural Audio-Visual Captions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08711) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.08711
**Authors:** Linli Yao, Yuancheng Wei, Yaojie Zhang, Lei Li, Xinlong Chen, Feifan Song, Ziyue Wang, Kun Ouyang, Yuanxin Liu, Lingpeng Kong, Qi Liu, Pengfei Wan, Kun Gai, Yuanxing Zhang, Xu Sun

**Abstract:**  This paper proposes Omni Dense Captioning, a novel task designed to generate continuous, fine-grained, and structured audio-visual narratives with explicit timestamps. To ensure dense semantic coverage, we introduce a six-dimensional structural schema to create "script-like" captions, enabling readers to vividly imagine the video content scene by scene, akin to a cinematographic screenplay. To facilitate research, we construct OmniDCBench, a high-quality, human-annotated benchmark, and propose SodaM, a unified metric that evaluates time-aware detailed descriptions while mitigating scene boundary ambiguity. Furthermore, we construct a training dataset, TimeChatCap-42K, and present TimeChat-Captioner-7B, a strong baseline trained via SFT and GRPO with task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeChat-Captioner-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro, while its generated dense descriptions significantly boost downstream capabilities in audio-visual reasoning (DailyOmni and WorldSense) and temporal grounding (Charades-STA). All datasets, models, and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yaolinli/TimeChat-Captioner.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2: This paper introduces TimeChat-Captioner, a strong multi-modal model for dense, time-aware audio-visual video captioning, and provides a new benchmark (OmniDCBench). It demonstrates state-of-the-art results and advances in VLLMs/MLLMs for structured video understanding.

## 7. [TLC-Plan: A Two-Level Codebook Based Network for End-to-End Vector Floorplan Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07100) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.07100
**Authors:** Biao Xiong, Zhen Peng, Ping Wang, Qiegen Liu, Xian Zhong

**Abstract:**  Automated floorplan generation aims to improve design quality, architectural efficiency, and sustainability by jointly modeling global spatial organization and precise geometric detail. However, existing approaches operate in raster space and rely on post hoc vectorization, which introduces structural inconsistencies and hinders end-to-end learning. Motivated by compositional spatial reasoning, we propose TLC-Plan, a hierarchical generative model that directly synthesizes vector floorplans from input boundaries, aligning with human architectural workflows based on modular and reusable patterns. TLC-Plan employs a two-level VQ-VAE to encode global layouts as semantically labeled room bounding boxes and to refine local geometries using polygon-level codes. This hierarchy is unified in a CodeTree representation, while an autoregressive transformer samples codes conditioned on the boundary to generate diverse and topologically valid designs, without requiring explicit room topology or dimensional priors. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on RPLAN dataset (FID = 1.84, MSE = 2.06) and leading results on LIFULL dataset. The proposed framework advances constraint-aware and scalable vector floorplan generation for real-world architectural applications. Source code and trained models are released at https://github.com/rosolose/TLC-PLAN.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 and 4: This paper proposes TLC-Plan, a hierarchical generative model for end-to-end vector floorplan generation, directly modeling spatial organization and geometric detail. It leverages compositional spatial reasoning and advances constraint-aware, scalable vector floorplan generation, which is a methodological improvement in spatial understanding and generative modeling.

## 8. [Vista: Scene-Aware Optimization for Streaming Video Question Answering under Post-Hoc Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08448) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.08448
**Authors:** Haocheng Lu, Nan Zhang, Wei Tao, Xiaoyang Qu, Guokuan Li, Jiguang Wan, Jianzong Wang

**Abstract:**  Streaming video question answering (Streaming Video QA) poses distinct challenges for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as video frames arrive sequentially and user queries can be issued at arbitrary time points. Existing solutions relying on fixed-size memory or naive compression often suffer from context loss or memory overflow, limiting their effectiveness in long-form, real-time scenarios. We present Vista, a novel framework for scene-aware streaming video QA that enables efficient and scalable reasoning over continuous video streams. The innovation of Vista can be summarized in three aspects: (1) scene-aware segmentation, where Vista dynamically clusters incoming frames into temporally and visually coherent scene units; (2) scene-aware compression, where each scene is compressed into a compact token representation and stored in GPU memory for efficient index-based retrieval, while full-resolution frames are offloaded to CPU memory; and (3) scene-aware recall, where relevant scenes are selectively recalled and reintegrated into the model input upon receiving a query, enabling both efficiency and completeness. Vista is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with a variety of vision-language backbones, enabling long-context reasoning without compromising latency or memory efficiency. Extensive experiments on StreamingBench demonstrate that Vista achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a strong baseline for real-world streaming video understanding.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new MLLMs/VLLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Vista is a novel framework for streaming video QA that is model-agnostic and integrates with vision-language backbones, enabling long-context reasoning for video streams. The scene-aware segmentation, compression, and recall are methodological improvements for video understanding in MLLMs.

## 9. [Learning to Continually Learn via Meta-learning Agentic Memory Designs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07755) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.07755
**Authors:** Yiming Xiong, Shengran Hu, Jeff Clune

**Abstract:**  The statelessness of foundation models bottlenecks agentic systems' ability to continually learn, a core capability for long-horizon reasoning and adaptation. To address this limitation, agentic systems commonly incorporate memory modules to retain and reuse past experience, aiming for continual learning during test time. However, most existing memory designs are human-crafted and fixed, which limits their ability to adapt to the diversity and non-stationarity of real-world tasks. In this paper, we introduce ALMA (Automated meta-Learning of Memory designs for Agentic systems), a framework that meta-learns memory designs to replace hand-engineered memory designs, therefore minimizing human effort and enabling agentic systems to be continual learners across diverse domains. Our approach employs a Meta Agent that searches over memory designs expressed as executable code in an open-ended manner, theoretically allowing the discovery of arbitrary memory designs, including database schemas as well as their retrieval and update mechanisms. Extensive experiments across four sequential decision-making domains demonstrate that the learned memory designs enable more effective and efficient learning from experience than state-of-the-art human-crafted memory designs on all benchmarks. When developed and deployed safely, ALMA represents a step toward self-improving AI systems that learn to be adaptive, continual learners.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3: This paper proposes a meta-learning framework (ALMA) for agentic memory design in continual learning, specifically for agentic systems in sequential decision-making domains. It addresses continual learning in embodied/agentic AI from a novel angle (meta-learned memory designs rather than hand-crafted), which previous work often ignored.

**Abstract:**  Agentic systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in tackling complex, long-horizon tasks. However, their efficacy is fundamentally constrained by static configurations governing agent behaviors, which are fixed prior to execution and fail to adapt to evolving task dynamics. Existing approaches, relying on manual orchestration or heuristic-based patches, often struggle with poor generalization and fragmented optimization. To transcend these limitations, we propose ToolSelf, a novel paradigm enabling tool-driven runtime self-reconfiguration. By abstracting configuration updates as a callable tool, ToolSelf unifies task execution and self-adjustment into a single action space, achieving a phase transition from external rules to intrinsic parameters. Agents can thereby autonomously update their sub-goals and context based on task progression, and correspondingly adapt their strategy and toolbox, transforming from passive executors into dual managers of both task and self. We further devise Configuration-Aware Two-stage Training (CAT), combining rejection sampling fine-tuning with trajectory-level reinforcement learning to internalize this meta-capability. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ToolSelf rivals specialized workflows while generalizing to novel tasks, achieving a 24.1% average performance gain and illuminating a path toward truly self-adaptive agents.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 3 (embodied AI, new methods for agent self-reconfiguration). Proposes ToolSelf, a new paradigm for agentic systems to self-reconfigure via tool-driven adaptation, with a novel training method and strong empirical results on agent adaptation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.07153
**Authors:** Jinbiao Wei, Yilun Zhao, Kangqi Ni, Arman Cohan

**Abstract:**  End-to-end GUI agents for real desktop environments require large amounts of high-quality interaction data, yet collecting human demonstrations is expensive and existing synthetic pipelines often suffer from limited task diversity or noisy, goal-drifting trajectories. We present a trajectory expansion framework Anchor that bootstraps scalable desktop supervision from a small set of verified seed demonstrations. Starting from each seed, we identify branch points that correspond to meaningful state changes and propose new, state-grounded task variants conditioned on the current GUI context. An executing agent then follows the proposed instructions to generate new trajectories, while a verifier enforces task completion via state-aware checks and trajectory-level consistency. To improve supervision quality, we further apply task-conditioned step-level filtering to remove ungrounded actions and denoise post-branch segments to maintain coherent intent. Experiments on standard desktop benchmarks, OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena, show that models fine-tuned on our expanded corpus achieve consistent improvements over zero-shot agents and representative synthesis baselines, and generalize across applications and operating systems.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3: Proposes ANCHOR, a new data generation framework for GUI agents, expanding high-quality interaction data for embodied agents in desktop environments. This is a new method for embodied AI data generation with a novel trajectory expansion approach.

**Abstract:**  Audio is indispensable for real-world video, yet generation models have largely overlooked audio components. Current approaches to producing audio-visual content often rely on cascaded pipelines, which increase cost, accumulate errors, and degrade overall quality. While systems such as Veo 3 and Sora 2 emphasize the value of simultaneous generation, joint multimodal modeling introduces unique challenges in architecture, data, and training. Moreover, the closed-source nature of existing systems limits progress in the field. In this work, we introduce MOVA (MOSS Video and Audio), an open-source model capable of generating high-quality, synchronized audio-visual content, including realistic lip-synced speech, environment-aware sound effects, and content-aligned music. MOVA employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, with a total of 32B parameters, of which 18B are active during inference. It supports IT2VA (Image-Text to Video-Audio) generation task. By releasing the model weights and code, we aim to advance research and foster a vibrant community of creators. The released codebase features comprehensive support for efficient inference, LoRA fine-tuning, and prompt enhancement.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2: Introduces MOVA, an open-source, large-scale model for synchronized video-audio generation with a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, supporting image-text to video-audio generation. This is a new VLLM/MLLM for generative multi-modal content.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.07106
**Authors:** Haoyu Zhang, Zhipeng Li, Yiwen Guo, Tianshu Yu

**Abstract:**  Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify multimodal understanding and generation, yet incorporating speech with 3D facial animation remains largely unexplored despite its importance for natural interaction. A key challenge arises from the representation mismatch between discrete, token-level semantic reasoning in LLMs and the dense, fine-grained temporal dynamics required for 3D facial motion, which makes direct modeling difficult to optimize under limited data. We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection. We further introduce InstructEx, a dataset aims to facilitate augment OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ex-Omni performs competitively against existing open-source OLLMs while enabling stable aligned speech and facial animation generation.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2: Shows a new omni-modal large language model (OLLM) that unifies multimodal understanding and generation, specifically incorporating speech and 3D facial animation, which is a novel multi-modal capability for LLMs.

**Authors:** Zehan Wang, Tengfei Wang, Haiyu Zhang, Xuhui Zuo, Junta Wu, Haoyuan Wang, Wenqiang Sun, Zhenwei Wang, Chenjie Cao, Hengshuang Zhao, Chunchao Guo, Zhou Zhao

**Abstract:**  This work presents WorldCompass, a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training framework for the long-horizon, interactive video-based world models, enabling them to explore the world more accurately and consistently based on interaction signals. To effectively "steer" the world model's exploration, we introduce three core innovations tailored to the autoregressive video generation paradigm: 1) Clip-level rollout Strategy: We generate and evaluate multiple samples at a single target clip, which significantly boosts rollout efficiency and provides fine-grained reward signals. 2) Complementary Reward Functions: We design reward functions for both interaction-following accuracy and visual quality, which provide direct supervision and effectively suppress reward-hacking behaviors. 3) Efficient RL Algorithm: We employ the negative-aware fine-tuning strategy coupled with various efficiency optimizations to efficiently and effectively enhance model capacity. Evaluations on the SoTA open-source world model, WorldPlay, demonstrate that WorldCompass significantly improves interaction accuracy and visual fidelity across various scenarios.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (embodied AI, new methods for world models, RL post-training for long-horizon interactive video-based world models). Introduces a new RL post-training framework with novel rollout and reward strategies for world models, which is a novel angle for improving embodied agent learning.

## 15. [TriC-Motion: Tri-Domain Causal Modeling Grounded Text-to-Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08462) <a id="link15"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.08462
**Authors:** Yiyang Cao, Yunze Deng, Ziyu Lin, Bin Feng, Xinggang Wang, Wenyu Liu, Dandan Zheng, Jingdong Chen

**Abstract:**  Text-to-motion generation, a rapidly evolving field in computer vision, aims to produce realistic and text-aligned motion sequences. Current methods primarily focus on spatial-temporal modeling or independent frequency domain analysis, lacking a unified framework for joint optimization across spatial, temporal, and frequency domains. This limitation hinders the model's ability to leverage information from all domains simultaneously, leading to suboptimal generation quality. Additionally, in motion generation frameworks, motion-irrelevant cues caused by noise are often entangled with features that contribute positively to generation, thereby leading to motion distortion. To address these issues, we propose Tri-Domain Causal Text-to-Motion Generation (TriC-Motion), a novel diffusion-based framework integrating spatial-temporal-frequency-domain modeling with causal intervention. TriC-Motion includes three core modeling modules for domain-specific modeling, namely Temporal Motion Encoding, Spatial Topology Modeling, and Hybrid Frequency Analysis. After comprehensive modeling, a Score-guided Tri-domain Fusion module integrates valuable information from the triple domains, simultaneously ensuring temporal consistency, spatial topology, motion trends, and dynamics. Moreover, the Causality-based Counterfactual Motion Disentangler is meticulously designed to expose motion-irrelevant cues to eliminate noise, disentangling the real modeling contributions of each domain for superior generation. Extensive experimental results validate that TriC-Motion achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, attaining an outstanding R@1 of 0.612 on the HumanML3D dataset. These results demonstrate its capability to generate high-fidelity, coherent, diverse, and text-aligned motion sequences. Code is available at: https://caoyiyang1105.github.io/TriC-Motion/.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (new methodological improvements to spatial understanding in embodied agents) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Proposes a novel tri-domain (spatial-temporal-frequency) causal modeling framework for text-to-motion generation, with explicit spatial topology modeling and causal disentanglement, which is a new angle for motion generation.

**Authors:** Sanoojan Baliah, Yohan Abeysinghe, Rusiru Thushara, Khan Muhammad, Abhinav Dhall, Karthik Nandakumar, Muhammad Haris Khan

**Abstract:**  We present a training-free, plug-and-play method, namely VFace, for high-quality face swapping in videos. It can be seamlessly integrated with image-based face swapping approaches built on diffusion models. First, we introduce a Frequency Spectrum Attention Interpolation technique to facilitate generation and intact key identity characteristics. Second, we achieve Target Structure Guidance via plug-and-play attention injection to better align the structural features from the target frame to the generation. Third, we present a Flow-Guided Attention Temporal Smoothening mechanism that enforces spatiotemporal coherence without modifying the underlying diffusion model to reduce temporal inconsistencies typically encountered in frame-wise generation. Our method requires no additional training or video-specific fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly enhances temporal consistency and visual fidelity, offering a practical and modular solution for video-based face swapping. Our code is available at https://github.com/Sanoojan/VFace.

**Authors:** Jingyu Hu, Bin Hu, Ka-Hei Hui, Haipeng Li, Zhengzhe Liu, Daniel Cohen-Or, Chi-Wing Fu

**Abstract:**  We present PEGAsus, a new framework capable of generating Personalized 3D shapes by learning shape concepts at both Geometry and Appearance levels. First, we formulate 3D shape personalization as extracting reusable, category-agnostic geometric and appearance attributes from reference shapes, and composing these attributes with text to generate novel shapes. Second, we design a progressive optimization strategy to learn shape concepts at both the geometry and appearance levels, decoupling the shape concept learning process. Third, we extend our approach to region-wise concept learning, enabling flexible concept extraction, with context-aware and context-free losses. Extensive experimental results show that PEGAsus is able to effectively extract attributes from a wide range of reference shapes and then flexibly compose these concepts with text to synthesize new shapes. This enables fine-grained control over shape generation and supports the creation of diverse, personalized results, even in challenging cross-category scenarios. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4: This paper presents PEGAsus, a framework for personalized 3D shape generation by learning geometry and appearance concepts, with fine-grained control and cross-category synthesis.

## 18. [Fair Context Learning for Evidence-Balanced Test-Time Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07027) <a id="link18"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.07027
**Authors:** Sanggeon Yun, Ryozo Masukawa, SungHeon Jeong, Wenjun Huang, Hanning Chen, Mohsen Imani

**Abstract:**  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP enable strong zero-shot recognition but suffer substantial degradation under distribution shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to improve robustness using only unlabeled test samples, yet most prompt-based TTA methods rely on entropy minimization -- an approach that can amplify spurious correlations and induce overconfident errors when classes share visual features. We propose Fair Context Learning (FCL), an episodic TTA framework that avoids entropy minimization by explicitly addressing shared-evidence bias. Motivated by our additive evidence decomposition assumption, FCL decouples adaptation into (i) augmentation-based exploration to identify plausible class candidates, and (ii) fairness-driven calibration that adapts text contexts to equalize sensitivity to common visual evidence. This fairness constraint mitigates partial feature obsession and enables effective calibration of text embeddings without relying on entropy reduction. Through extensive evaluation, we empirically validate our theoretical motivation and show that FCL achieves competitive adaptation performance relative to state-of-the-art TTA methods across diverse domain-shift and fine-grained benchmarks.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Proposes a new test-time adaptation framework for vision-language models (VLMs) that avoids entropy minimization and introduces fairness-driven calibration, which is a clever statistical trick for robust adaptation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.07034
**Authors:** Jinxiu Qu, Zirui Tang, Hongzhang Huang, Boyu Niu, Wei Zhou, Jiannan Wang, Yitong Song, Guoliang Li, Xuanhe Zhou, Fan Wu

**Abstract:**  Semi-structured table question answering (QA) is a challenging task that requires (1) precise extraction of cell contents and positions and (2) accurate recovery of key implicit logical structures, hierarchical relationships, and semantic associations encoded in table layouts. In practice, such tables are often interpreted manually by human experts, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. However, automating this process remains difficult. Existing Text-to-SQL methods typically require converting semi-structured tables into structured formats, inevitably leading to information loss, while approaches like Text-to-Code and multimodal LLM-based QA struggle with complex layouts and often yield inaccurate answers. To address these limitations, we present ST-Raptor, an agentic system for semi-structured table QA. ST-Raptor offers an interactive analysis environment that combines visual editing, tree-based structural modeling, and agent-driven query resolution to support accurate and user-friendly table understanding. Experimental results on both benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that ST-Raptor outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and usability. The code is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor, and a demonstration video is available at https://youtu.be/9GDR-94Cau4.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new MLLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications).

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.08603
**Authors:** Teng Wang, Rong Shan, Jianghao Lin, Junjie Wu, Tianyi Xu, Jianping Zhang, Wenteng Chen, Changwang Zhang, Zhaoxiang Wang, Weinan Zhang, Jun Wang

**Abstract:**  Composed image retrieval (CIR) requires complex reasoning over heterogeneous visual and textual constraints. Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: unified embedding retrieval, which suffers from single-model myopia, and heuristic agentic retrieval, which is limited by suboptimal, trial-and-error orchestration. To this end, we propose OSCAR, an optimization-steered agentic planning framework for composed image retrieval. We are the first to reformulate agentic CIR from a heuristic search process into a principled trajectory optimization problem. Instead of relying on heuristic trial-and-error exploration, OSCAR employs a novel offline-online paradigm. In the offline phase, we model CIR via atomic retrieval selection and composition as a two-stage mixed-integer programming problem, mathematically deriving optimal trajectories that maximize ground-truth coverage for training samples via rigorous boolean set operations. These trajectories are then stored in a golden library to serve as in-context demonstrations for online steering of VLM planner at online inference time. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and a private industrial benchmark show that OSCAR consistently outperforms SOTA baselines. Notably, it achieves superior performance using only 10% of training data, demonstrating strong generalization of planning logic rather than dataset-specific memorization.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.07749
**Authors:** Zhenyu Wu, Yanxi Long, Jian Li, Hua Huang

**Abstract:**  Program code serves as a bridge linking vision and logic, providing a feasible supervisory approach for enhancing the multimodal reasoning capability of large models through geometric operations such as auxiliary line construction and perspective transformation. Nevertheless, current inverse graphics methods face tremendous challenges in accurately reconstructing complex geometric details, which often results in the loss of key geometric constraints or structural distortion. To address this bottleneck, we propose Geo-coder -- the first inverse programming framework for geometric images based on a multi-agent system. Our method innovatively decouples the process into geometric modeling via pixel-wise anchoring and metric-driven code evolution: Stage 1 leverages the complementary advantages of visual operators and large models to achieve precise capture of pixel coordinates and visual attributes; Stage 2 introduces a synthesis-rendering-validation closed loop, where bidirectional visual feedback drives the self-correction of code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Geo-coder achieves a substantial lead in both geometric reconstruction accuracy and visual consistency. Notably, by effectively preserving the core geometric semantics, the images reconstructed with our method exhibit equivalent performance to the original ones in multimodal reasoning tasks, which fully validates the robustness of the framework. Finally, to further reduce research costs, we have open-sourced the Geo-coder dataset constructed on the GeoCode framework, which contains more than 1,500 samples. On this basis, we have also open-sourced the GeocodeLM model, laying a solid data and model foundation for subsequent research in this field.

**Comment:** Partially matches criterion 2 and 4: Proposes a novel inverse programming framework (Geo-coder) for geometric images, bridging vision and logic, and open-sources a dataset and model (GeocodeLM) for multimodal reasoning. This is a new method for vision-language reasoning with code, which is a novel angle.

**Authors:** Yichi Zhang, Feiyang Xiao, Le Xue, Wenbo Zhang, Gang Feng, Chenguang Zheng, Yuan Qi, Yuan Cheng, Zixin Hu

**Abstract:**  While emerging 3D medical foundation models are envisioned as versatile tools with offer general-purpose capabilities, their validation remains largely confined to regional and structural imaging, leaving a significant modality discrepancy unexplored. To provide a rigorous and objective assessment, we curate the UMD dataset comprising 490 whole-body PET/CT and 464 whole-body PET/MRI scans ($\sim$675k 2D images, $\sim$12k 3D organ annotations) and conduct a thorough and comprehensive evaluation of representative 3D segmentation foundation models. Through intra-subject controlled comparisons of paired scans, we isolate imaging modality as the primary independent variable to evaluate model robustness in real-world applications. Our evaluation reveals a stark discrepancy between literature-reported benchmarks and real-world efficacy, particularly when transitioning from structural to functional domains. Such systemic failures underscore that current 3D foundation models are far from achieving truly general-purpose status, necessitating a paradigm shift toward multi-modal training and evaluation to bridge the gap between idealized benchmarking and comprehensive clinical utility. This dataset and analysis establish a foundational cornerstone for future research to develop truly modality-agnostic medical foundation models.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.08620
**Authors:** Siyu Liu, Chujie Qin, Hubery Yin, Qixin Yan, Zheng-Peng Duan, Chen Li, Jing Lyu, Chun-Le Guo, Chongyi Li

**Abstract:**  Recent work leverages Vision Foundation Models as image encoders to boost the generative performance of latent diffusion models (LDMs), as their semantic feature distributions are easy to learn. However, such semantic features often lack low-level information (\eg, color and texture), leading to degraded reconstruction fidelity, which has emerged as a primary bottleneck in further scaling LDMs. To address this limitation, we propose LV-RAE, a representation autoencoder that augments semantic features with missing low-level information, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction while remaining highly aligned with the semantic distribution. We further observe that the resulting high-dimensional, information-rich latent make decoders sensitive to latent perturbations, causing severe artifacts when decoding generated latent and consequently degrading generation quality. Our analysis suggests that this sensitivity primarily stems from excessive decoder responses along directions off the data manifold. Building on these insights, we propose fine-tuning the decoder to increase its robustness and smoothing the generated latent via controlled noise injection, thereby enhancing generation quality. Experiments demonstrate that LV-RAE significantly improves reconstruction fidelity while preserving the semantic abstraction and achieving strong generative quality. Our code is available at https://github.com/modyu-liu/LVRAE.

## 24. [Multimodal Learning for Arcing Detection in Pantograph-Catenary Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08792) <a id="link24"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.08792
**Authors:** Hao Dong, Eleni Chatzi, Olga Fink

**Abstract:**  The pantograph-catenary interface is essential for ensuring uninterrupted and reliable power delivery in electrified rail systems. However, electrical arcing at this interface poses serious risks, including accelerated wear of contact components, degraded system performance, and potential service disruptions. Detecting arcing events at the pantograph-catenary interface is challenging due to their transient nature, noisy operating environment, data scarcity, and the difficulty of distinguishing arcs from other similar transient phenomena. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework that combines high-resolution image data with force measurements to more accurately and robustly detect arcing events. First, we construct two arcing detection datasets comprising synchronized visual and force measurements. One dataset is built from data provided by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), and the other is derived from publicly available videos of arcing events in different railway systems and synthetic force data that mimic the characteristics observed in the real dataset. Leveraging these datasets, we propose MultiDeepSAD, an extension of the DeepSAD algorithm for multiple modalities with a new loss formulation. Additionally, we introduce tailored pseudo-anomaly generation techniques specific to each data type, such as synthetic arc-like artifacts in images and simulated force irregularities, to augment training data and improve the discriminative ability of the model. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline approaches, exhibiting enhanced sensitivity to real arcing events even under domain shifts and limited availability of real arcing observations.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new MLLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Proposes a novel multimodal learning framework for arcing detection, combining image and force data, with new loss and pseudo-anomaly generation techniques. Application is specific, but the method is generalizable.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.08586
**Authors:** Yiming Yang, Zhuoyuan Li, Fanxiang Zeng, Hao Fu, Yue Liu

**Abstract:**  Multi-agent collaboration has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing approaches remain largely heuristic, lacking principled guidance on what drives performance gains and how to systematically optimize multi-agent reasoning. Specifically, it remains unclear why multi-agent collaboration outperforms single-agent reasoning and which design choices contribute most to these gains, making it difficult to build better systems.   We address this gap by introducing a unified theoretical framework that decomposes multi-agent reasoning gains into three conceptually independent dimensions: Exploration for diverse solution coverage, Information for high-fidelity feedback, and Aggregation for principled consensus. Through this lens, existing methods can be understood as special cases that optimize only subsets of these dimensions. Building upon this decomposition, a novel framework called PRISM (Propose-Review-Integrate Synthesis for Multi-agent Reasoning) is proposed, which jointly maximizes all three dimensions through role-based diversity, execution-grounded feedback with evidence-based cross-evaluation, and iterative synthesis with closed-loop validation. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and function calling benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior compute-efficiency compared to methods optimizing partial dimensions. The theoretical framework provides actionable design principles for future multi-agent reasoning systems.

**Comment:** This paper introduces a principled framework (PRISM) for multi-agent reasoning with LLMs, decomposing gains into exploration, information, and aggregation. While it is a novel approach to multi-agent LLM reasoning, it does not focus on spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

**Authors:** Zixuan Huang, Xin Xia, Yuxi Ren, Jianbin Zheng, Xuanda Wang, Zhixia Zhang, Hongyan Xie, Songshi Liang, Zehao Chen, Xuefeng Xiao, Fuzhen Zhuang, Jianxin Li, Yikun Ban, Deqing Wang

**Abstract:**  Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have greatly improved their capabilities on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chains of Thought (CoTs). However, this approach often results in substantial redundancy, impairing computational efficiency and causing significant delays in real-time applications. Recent studies show that longer reasoning chains are frequently uncorrelated with correctness and can even be detrimental to accuracy. In a further in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, we surprisingly uncover and empirically verify that LRMs implicitly know the appropriate time to stop thinking, while this capability is obscured by current sampling paradigms. Motivated by this, we introduce SAGE (Self-Aware Guided Efficient Reasoning), a novel sampling paradigm that unleashes this efficient reasoning potential. Furthermore, integrating SAGE as mixed sampling into group-based reinforcement learning (SAGE-RL) enables SAGE-RL to effectively incorporate SAGE-discovered efficient reasoning patterns into standard pass@1 inference, markedly enhancing both the reasoning accuracy and efficiency of LRMs across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks.

**Comment:** This paper investigates reasoning efficiency in large reasoning models and introduces a new sampling paradigm (SAGE). While it is an interesting empirical study and clever statistical trick, it is not directly about spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

**Abstract:**  We introduce InternAgent-1.5, a unified system designed for end-to-end scientific discovery across computational and empirical domains. The system is built on a structured architecture composed of three coordinated subsystems for generation, verification, and evolution. These subsystems are supported by foundational capabilities for deep research, solution optimization, and long horizon memory. The architecture allows InternAgent-1.5 to operate continuously across extended discovery cycles while maintaining coherent and improving behavior. It also enables the system to coordinate computational modeling and laboratory experimentation within a single unified system. We evaluate InternAgent-1.5 on scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GAIA, HLE, GPQA, and FrontierScience, and the system achieves leading performance that demonstrates strong foundational capabilities. Beyond these benchmarks, we further assess two categories of discovery tasks. In algorithm discovery tasks, InternAgent-1.5 autonomously designs competitive methods for core machine learning problems. In empirical discovery tasks, it executes complete computational or wet lab experiments and produces scientific findings in earth, life, biological, and physical domains. Overall, these results show that InternAgent-1.5 provides a general and scalable framework for autonomous scientific discovery.

**Comment:** This paper introduces a unified agentic framework for autonomous scientific discovery, with strong performance on scientific reasoning benchmarks. While it is a large-scale agentic system, it is not specifically about spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI benchmarks, or vision foundation models. It is more about general AI agents for science.

## 28. [TIBR4D: Tracing-Guided Iterative Boundary Refinement for Efficient 4D Gaussian Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08540) <a id="link28"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.08540
**Authors:** He Wu, Xia Yan, Yanghui Xu, Liegang Xia, Jiazhou Chen

**Abstract:**  Object-level segmentation in dynamic 4D Gaussian scenes remains challenging due to complex motion, occlusions, and ambiguous boundaries. In this paper, we present an efficient learning-free 4D Gaussian segmentation framework that lifts video segmentation masks to 4D spaces, whose core is a two-stage iterative boundary refinement, TIBR4D. The first stage is an Iterative Gaussian Instance Tracing (IGIT) at the temporal segment level. It progressively refines Gaussian-to-instance probabilities through iterative tracing, and extracts corresponding Gaussian point clouds that better handle occlusions and preserve completeness of object structures compared to existing one-shot threshold-based methods. The second stage is a frame-wise Gaussian Rendering Range Control (RCC) via suppressing highly uncertain Gaussians near object boundaries while retaining their core contributions for more accurate boundaries. Furthermore, a temporal segmentation merging strategy is proposed for IGIT to balance identity consistency and dynamic awareness. Longer segments enforce stronger multi-frame constraints for stable identities, while shorter segments allow identity changes to be captured promptly. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D demonstrate that our method produces accurate object Gaussian point clouds with clearer boundaries and higher efficiency compared to SOTA methods.

**Comment:** Somewhat related to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications), but focuses on segmentation in 4D Gaussian scenes with a learning-free framework. Novel for 4D segmentation, but not directly about foundation models or embodied agents.

## 29. [Data Darwinism Part I: Unlocking the Value of Scientific Data for Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07824) <a id="link29"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.07824
**Authors:** Yiwei Qin, Zhen Huang, Tiantian Mi, Weiye Si, Chenyang Zhou, Qipeng Guo, Siyuan Feng, Pengfei Liu

**Abstract:**  Data quality determines foundation model performance, yet systematic processing frameworks are lacking. We introduce Data Darwinism, a ten-level taxonomy (L0-L9) that conceptualizes data-model co-evolution: advanced models produce superior data for next-generation systems. We validate this on scientific literature by constructing Darwin-Science, a 900B-token corpus (L0-L5). We identify a learnability gap in raw scientific text, which we bridge via L4 (Generative Refinement) and L5 (Cognitive Completion) using frontier LLMs to explicate reasoning and terminology.   To ensure rigorous attribution, we pre-trained daVinci-origin-3B/7B models from scratch, excluding scientific content to create contamination-free baselines. After 600B tokens of continued pre-training, Darwin-Science outperforms baselines by +2.12 (3B) and +2.95 (7B) points across 20+ benchmarks, rising to +5.60 and +8.40 points on domain-aligned tasks. Systematic progression to L5 yields a +1.36 total gain, confirming that higher-level processing unlocks latent data value. We release the Darwin-Science corpus and daVinci-origin models to enable principled, co-evolutionary development.

**Comment:** Somewhat related to criterion 4 (foundation models and data curation for pre-training), but focuses on data processing for language models, not vision or multi-modal models. Interesting for those interested in data/model co-evolution, but not a direct match.

## 30. [Towards Adaptive, Scalable, and Robust Coordination of LLM Agents: A Dynamic Ad-Hoc Networking Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08009) <a id="link30"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.08009
**Authors:** Rui Li, Zeyu Zhang, Xiaohe Bo, Quanyu Dai, Chaozhuo Li, Feng Wen, Xu Chen

**Abstract:**  Multi-agent architectures built on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the potential to realize swarm intelligence through well-crafted collaboration. However, the substantial burden of manual orchestration inherently raises an imperative to automate the design of agentic workflows. We frame such an agent coordination challenge as a classic problem in dynamic ad-hoc networking: How to establish adaptive and reliable communication among a scalable number of agentic hosts? In response to this unresolved dilemma, we introduce RAPS, a reputation-aware publish-subscribe paradigm for adaptive, scalable, and robust coordination of LLM agents. RAPS is grounded in the Distributed Publish-Subscribe Protocol, allowing LLM agents to exchange messages based on their declared intents rather than predefined topologies. Beyond this substrate, RAPS further incorporates two coherent overlays: (i) Reactive Subscription, enabling agents to dynamically refine their intents; and (ii) Bayesian Reputation, empowering each agent with a local watchdog to detect and isolate malicious peers. Extensive experiments over five benchmarks showcase that our design effectively reconciles adaptivity, scalability, and robustness in a unified multi-agent coordination framework.

**Comment:** This paper presents a new paradigm for multi-agent LLM coordination using a publish-subscribe protocol. While it is relevant to multi-agent LLMs, it does not focus on spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI benchmarks, or vision foundation models. It is more about agent communication protocols.

## 31. [BRIDGE: Predicting Human Task Completion Time From Model Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07267) <a id="link31"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.07267
**Authors:** Fengyuan Liu, Jay Gala, Nilaksh, Dzmitry Bahdanau, Siva Reddy, Hugo Larochelle

**Abstract:**  Evaluating the real-world capabilities of AI systems requires grounding benchmark performance in human-interpretable measures of task difficulty. Existing approaches that rely on direct human task completion time annotations are costly, noisy, and difficult to scale across benchmarks. In this work, we propose BRIDGE, a unified psychometric framework that learns the latent difficulty scale from model responses and anchors it to human task completion time. Using a two-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model, we jointly estimate latent task difficulty and model capability from model performance data across multiple benchmarks. We demonstrate that latent task difficulty varies linearly with the logarithm of human completion time, allowing human task completion time to be inferred for new benchmarks from model performance alone. Leveraging this alignment, we forecast frontier model capabilities in terms of human task length and independently reproduce METR's exponential scaling results, with the 50% solvable task horizon doubling approximately every 6 months.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a psychometric framework for inferring human task completion time from model performance. While it is a clever statistical trick and relevant to evaluation, it does not directly match the criteria focused on spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

## 32. [Who Deserves the Reward? SHARP: Shapley Credit-based Optimization for Multi-Agent System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08335) <a id="link32"></a>

**Authors:** Yanming Li, Xuelin Zhang, WenJie Lu, Ziye Tang, Maodong Wu, Haotian Luo, Tongtong Wu, Zijie Peng, Hongze Mi, Yibo Feng, Naiqiang Tan, Chao Huang, Hong Chen, Li Shen

**Abstract:**  Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools via multi-agent systems offers a promising new paradigm for decomposing and solving complex problems. However, training these systems remains notoriously difficult due to the credit assignment challenge, as it is often unclear which specific functional agent is responsible for the success or failure of decision trajectories. Existing methods typically rely on sparse or globally broadcast rewards, failing to capture individual contributions and leading to inefficient reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we introduce the Shapley-based Hierarchical Attribution for Reinforcement Policy (SHARP), a novel framework for optimizing multi-agent reinforcement learning via precise credit attribution. SHARP effectively stabilizes training by normalizing agent-specific advantages across trajectory groups, primarily through a decomposed reward mechanism comprising a global broadcast-accuracy reward, a Shapley-based marginal-credit reward for each agent, and a tool-process reward to improve execution efficiency. Extensive experiments across various real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SHARP significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average match improvements of 23.66% and 14.05% over single-agent and multi-agent approaches, respectively.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a new Shapley-based credit assignment method for multi-agent reinforcement learning, but it does not focus on spatial understanding, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI benchmarks, or vision foundation models. It is more about RL credit assignment.

## 33. [Structure-Aware Robust Counterfactual Explanations via Conditional Gaussian Network Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08021) <a id="link33"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.08021
**Authors:** Zhan-Yi Liao, Jaewon Yoo, Hao-Tsung Yang, Po-An Chen

**Abstract:**  Counterfactual explanation (CE) is a core technique in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), widely used to interpret model decisions and suggest actionable alternatives. This work presents a structure-aware and robustness-oriented counterfactual search method based on the conditional Gaussian network classifier (CGNC). The CGNC has a generative structure that encodes conditional dependencies and potential causal relations among features through a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This structure naturally embeds feature relationships into the search process, eliminating the need for additional constraints to ensure consistency with the model's structural assumptions. We adopt a convergence-guaranteed cutting-set procedure as an adversarial optimization framework, which iteratively approximates solutions that satisfy global robustness conditions. To address the nonconvex quadratic structure induced by feature dependencies, we apply piecewise McCormick relaxation to reformulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), ensuring global optimality. Experimental results show that our method achieves strong robustness, with direct global optimization of the original formulation providing especially stable and efficient results. The proposed framework is extensible to more complex constraint settings, laying the groundwork for future advances in counterfactual reasoning under nonconvex quadratic formulations.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a structure-aware method for robust counterfactual explanations using conditional Gaussian network classifiers. While it is a methodological contribution in explainable AI, it does not address spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

## 34. [LLM-FSM: Scaling Large Language Models for Finite-State Reasoning in RTL Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07032) <a id="link34"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.07032
**Authors:** Yuheng Wu, Berk Gokmen, Zhouhua Xie, Peijing Li, Caroline Trippel, Priyanka Raina, Thierry Tambe

**Abstract:**  Finite-state reasoning, the ability to understand and implement state-dependent behavior, is central to hardware design. In this paper, we present LLM-FSM, a benchmark that evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can recover finite-state machine (FSM) behavior from natural-language specifications and translate it into correct register transfer-level (RTL) implementations. Unlike prior specification-to-RTL benchmarks that rely on manually constructed examples, LLM-FSM is built through a fully automated pipeline. LLM-FSM first constructs FSM with configurable state counts and constrained transition structures. It then prompts LLMs to express each FSM in a structured YAML format with an application context, and to further convert that YAML into a natural-language (NL) specification. From the same YAML, our pipeline synthesizes the reference RTL and testbench in a correct-by-construction manner. All 1,000 problems are verified using LLM-based and SAT-solver-based checks, with human review on a subset. Our experiments show that even the strongest LLMs exhibit sharply declining accuracy as FSM complexity increases. We further demonstrate that training-time scaling via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, while increasing test-time compute improves reasoning reliability. Finally, LLM-FSM remains extensible by allowing its FSM complexity to scale with future model capabilities.

**Comment:** This paper introduces LLM-FSM, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on finite-state reasoning for RTL code generation. While it is a new benchmark, it is not focused on embodied AI, spatial intelligence, or vision-language models. It is more about code generation and reasoning in LLMs.

## 35. [Efficient and Stable Reinforcement Learning for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08905) <a id="link35"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.08905
**Authors:** Jiawei Liu, Xiting Wang, Yuanyuan Zhong, Defu Lian, Yu Yang

**Abstract:**  Reinforcement Learning (RL) is crucial for unlocking the complex reasoning capabilities of Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs). However, applying RL to dLLMs faces unique challenges in efficiency and stability. To address these challenges, we propose Spatio-Temporal Pruning (STP), a framework designed to simultaneously improve the efficiency and stability of RL for dLLMs. STP compresses the redundancy in the generative process through: (1) \textit{spatial pruning}, which constrains the exploration space using static priors; and (2) \textit{temporal pruning}, which bypasses redundant late-stage refinement steps. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that STP strictly reduces the variance of the log-likelihood estimation, thereby ensuring more stable policy updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STP surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lolo1222/STP.

**Comment:** This paper introduces a spatio-temporal pruning framework for efficient and stable RL in diffusion-based LLMs. While the 'spatio-temporal' term is used, it refers to the generative process rather than spatial intelligence in embodied agents or vision. It is not about VLLMs/MLLMs or vision foundation models.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.07253
**Authors:** Litian Liu, Reza Pourreza, Yubing Jian, Yao Qin, Roland Memisevic

**Abstract:**  Detecting hallucinations in large language models is a critical open problem with significant implications for safety and reliability. While existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance in question-answering tasks, they remain less effective on tasks requiring reasoning. In this work, we revisit hallucination detection through the lens of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, a well-studied problem in areas like computer vision. Treating next-token prediction in language models as a classification task allows us to apply OOD techniques, provided appropriate modifications are made to account for the structural differences in large language models. We show that OOD-based approaches yield training-free, single-sample-based detectors, achieving strong accuracy in hallucination detection for reasoning tasks. Overall, our work suggests that reframing hallucination detection as OOD detection provides a promising and scalable pathway toward language model safety.

**Comment:** This paper reframes hallucination detection in LLMs as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, drawing on techniques from computer vision. While it is an interesting methodological contribution, it does not directly address spatial understanding, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models. It is more about language model safety and OOD detection.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.08412
**Authors:** Yuhang Wang, Feiming Xu, Zheng Lin, Guangyu He, Yuzhe Huang, Haichang Gao, Zhenxing Niu

**Abstract:**  Although large language model (LLM)-based agents, exemplified by OpenClaw, are increasingly evolving from task-oriented systems into personalized AI assistants for solving complex real-world tasks, their practical deployment also introduces severe security risks. However, existing agent security research and evaluation frameworks primarily focus on synthetic or task-centric settings, and thus fail to accurately capture the attack surface and risk propagation mechanisms of personalized agents in real-world deployments. To address this gap, we propose Personalized Agent Security Bench (PASB), an end-to-end security evaluation framework tailored for real-world personalized agents. Building upon existing agent attack paradigms, PASB incorporates personalized usage scenarios, realistic toolchains, and long-horizon interactions, enabling black-box, end-to-end security evaluation on real systems. Using OpenClaw as a representative case study, we systematically evaluate its security across multiple personalized scenarios, tool capabilities, and attack types. Our results indicate that OpenClaw exhibits critical vulnerabilities at different execution stages, including user prompt processing, tool usage, and memory retrieval, highlighting substantial security risks in personalized agent deployments. The code for the proposed PASB framework is available at https://github.com/AstorYH/PASB.

## 38. [Visualizing the Invisible: Enhancing Radiologist Performance in Breast Mammography via Task-Driven Chromatic Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07568) <a id="link38"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.07568
**Authors:** Hui Ye, Shilong Yang, Yexuan Xing, Juan Yu, Yaoqin Xie, Wei Zhang, Chulong Zhang

**Abstract:**  Purpose:Mammography screening is less sensitive in dense breasts, where tissue overlap and subtle findings increase perceptual difficulty. We present MammoColor, an end-to-end framework with a Task-Driven Chromatic Encoding (TDCE) module that converts single-channel mammograms into TDCE-encoded views for visual augmentation. Materials and Methods:MammoColor couples a lightweight TDCE module with a BI-RADS triage classifier and was trained end-to-end on VinDr-Mammo. Performance was evaluated on an internal test set, two public datasets (CBIS-DDSM and INBreast), and three external clinical cohorts. We also conducted a multi-reader, multi-case (MRMC) observer study with a washout period, comparing (1) grayscale-only, (2) TDCE-only, and (3) side-by-side grayscale+TDCE. Results:On VinDr-Mammo, MammoColor improved AUC from 0.7669 to 0.8461 (P=0.004). Gains were larger in dense breasts (AUC 0.749 to 0.835). In the MRMC study, TDCE-encoded images improved specificity (0.90 to 0.96; P=0.052) with comparable sensitivity. Conclusion:TDCE provides a task-optimized chromatic representation that may improve perceptual salience and reduce false-positive recalls in mammography triage.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a novel chromatic encoding for mammography images to improve radiologist performance. While it is a new vision method, it is focused on medical imaging and not directly on spatial intelligence for embodied agents, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI benchmarks, or vision foundation models. It is relevant to computer vision but not a direct match to the criteria.

## 39. [Bidirectional Reward-Guided Diffusion for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07069) <a id="link39"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.07069
**Authors:** Zihao Fan, Xin Lu, Yidi Liu, Jie Huang, Dong Li, Xueyang Fu, Zheng-Jun Zha

**Abstract:**  Diffusion-based super-resolution can synthesize rich details, but models trained on synthetic paired data often fail on real-world LR images due to distribution shifts. We propose Bird-SR, a bidirectional reward-guided diffusion framework that formulates super-resolution as trajectory-level preference optimization via reward feedback learning (ReFL), jointly leveraging synthetic LR-HR pairs and real-world LR images. For structural fidelity easily affected in ReFL, the model is directly optimized on synthetic pairs at early diffusion steps, which also facilitates structure preservation for real-world inputs under smaller distribution gap in structure levels. For perceptual enhancement, quality-guided rewards are applied at later sampling steps to both synthetic and real LR images. To mitigate reward hacking, the rewards for synthetic results are formulated in a relative advantage space bounded by their clean counterparts, while real-world optimization is regularized via a semantic alignment constraint. Furthermore, to balance structural and perceptual learning, we adopt a dynamic fidelity-perception weighting strategy that emphasizes structure preservation at early stages and progressively shifts focus toward perceptual optimization at later diffusion steps. Extensive experiments on real-world SR benchmarks demonstrate that Bird-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality while preserving structural consistency, validating its effectiveness for real-world super-resolution.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a new diffusion-based super-resolution method with reward-guided optimization. While it is a generative vision method, it does not directly address spatial understanding, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

**Abstract:**  The development of artificial intelligence can be viewed as an evolution of data-driven learning paradigms, with successive shifts in data organization and utilization continuously driving advances in model capability. Current LLM research is dominated by a paradigm that relies heavily on unidirectional scaling of data size, increasingly encountering bottlenecks in data availability, acquisition cost, and training efficiency. In this work, we argue that the development of AGI is entering a new phase of data-model co-evolution, in which models actively guide data management while high-quality data, in turn, amplifies model capabilities. To implement this vision, we propose a tiered data management framework, designed to support the full LLM training lifecycle across heterogeneous learning objectives and cost constraints. Specifically, we introduce an L0-L4 tiered data management framework, ranging from raw uncurated resources to organized and verifiable knowledge. Importantly, LLMs are fully used in data management processes, such as quality scoring and content editing, to refine data across tiers. Each tier is characterized by distinct data properties, management strategies, and training roles, enabling data to be strategically allocated across LLM training stages, including pre-training, mid-training, and alignment. The framework balances data quality, acquisition cost, and marginal training benefit, providing a systematic approach to scalable and sustainable data management. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through empirical studies, in which tiered datasets are constructed from raw corpora and used across multiple training phases. Experimental results demonstrate that tier-aware data utilization significantly improves training efficiency and model performance. To facilitate further research, we release our tiered datasets and processing tools to the community.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a tiered data management framework for LLM training, focusing on data-model co-evolution. While it is a methodological improvement for LLMs, it does not focus on spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models. It is more about data curation and management for LLMs.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.07428
**Authors:** Chengqi Dong, Zhiyuan Cao, Tuoshi Qi, Kexin Wu, Yixing Gao, Fan Tang

**Abstract:**  U-Net structure is widely used for low-light image/video enhancement. The enhanced images result in areas with large local noise and loss of more details without proper guidance for global information. Attention mechanisms can better focus on and use global information. However, attention to images could significantly increase the number of parameters and computations. We propose a Row-Column Separated Attention module (RCSA) inserted after an improved U-Net. The RCSA module's input is the mean and maximum of the row and column of the feature map, which utilizes global information to guide local information with fewer parameters. We propose two temporal loss functions to apply the method to low-light video enhancement and maintain temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the LOL, MIT Adobe FiveK image, and SDSD video datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/cq-dong/URCSA.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a new attention module (Row-Column Separated Attention) for low-light image/video enhancement, but it does not address spatial understanding in embodied agents, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI benchmarks, or vision foundation models. It is a computer vision method, but not a direct match to the criteria.
