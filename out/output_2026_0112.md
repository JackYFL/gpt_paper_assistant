## 0. [Thinking with Map: Reinforced Parallel Map-Augmented Agent for Geolocalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05432) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05432
**Authors:** Yuxiang Ji, Yong Wang, Ziyu Ma, Yiming Hu, Hailang Huang, Xuecai Hu, Guanhua Chen, Liaoni Wu, Xiangxiang Chu

**Abstract:**  The image geolocalization task aims to predict the location where an image was taken anywhere on Earth using visual clues. Existing large vision-language model (LVLM) approaches leverage world knowledge, chain-of-thought reasoning, and agentic capabilities, but overlook a common strategy used by humans -- using maps. In this work, we first equip the model \textit{Thinking with Map} ability and formulate it as an agent-in-the-map loop. We develop a two-stage optimization scheme for it, including agentic reinforcement learning (RL) followed by parallel test-time scaling (TTS). The RL strengthens the agentic capability of model to improve sampling efficiency, and the parallel TTS enables the model to explore multiple candidate paths before making the final prediction, which is crucial for geolocalization. To evaluate our method on up-to-date and in-the-wild images, we further present MAPBench, a comprehensive geolocalization training and evaluation benchmark composed entirely of real-world images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing open- and closed-source models on most metrics, specifically improving Acc@500m from 8.0\% to 22.1\% compared to \textit{Gemini-3-Pro} with Google Search/Map grounded mode.

**Comment:** This paper introduces a map-augmented agent for geolocalization, equipping a model with 'Thinking with Map' ability and proposing a new agent-in-the-map loop, RL optimization, and a new benchmark (MAPBench). This directly matches criterion 1 (spatial understanding on embodied agents) and criterion 3 (new benchmark for embodied AI with novel angle).

## 1. [SGDrive: Scene-to-Goal Hierarchical World Cognition for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05640) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05640
**Authors:** Jingyu Li, Junjie Wu, Dongnan Hu, Xiangkai Huang, Bin Sun, Zhihui Hao, Xianpeng Lang, Xiatian Zhu, Li Zhang

**Abstract:**  Recent end-to-end autonomous driving approaches have leveraged Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance planning capabilities in complex driving scenarios. However, VLMs are inherently trained as generalist models, lacking specialized understanding of driving-specific reasoning in 3D space and time. When applied to autonomous driving, these models struggle to establish structured spatial-temporal representations that capture geometric relationships, scene context, and motion patterns critical for safe trajectory planning. To address these limitations, we propose SGDrive, a novel framework that explicitly structures the VLM's representation learning around driving-specific knowledge hierarchies. Built upon a pre-trained VLM backbone, SGDrive decomposes driving understanding into a scene-agent-goal hierarchy that mirrors human driving cognition: drivers first perceive the overall environment (scene context), then attend to safety-critical agents and their behaviors, and finally formulate short-term goals before executing actions. This hierarchical decomposition provides the structured spatial-temporal representation that generalist VLMs lack, integrating multi-level information into a compact yet comprehensive format for trajectory planning. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that SGDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance among camera-only methods on both PDMS and EPDMS, validating the effectiveness of hierarchical knowledge structuring for adapting generalist VLMs to autonomous driving.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (spatial intelligence on embodied agents) and criterion 3 (embodied AI, new methods for spatial-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving). SGDrive introduces a hierarchical cognition framework for VLMs in driving, structuring spatial-temporal representations for trajectory planning.

## 2. [SceneAlign: Aligning Multimodal Reasoning to Scene Graphs in Complex Visual Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05600) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05600
**Authors:** Chuhan Wang, Xintong Li, Jennifer Yuntong Zhang, Junda Wu, Chengkai Huang, Lina Yao, Julian McAuley, Jingbo Shang

**Abstract:**  Multimodal large language models often struggle with faithful reasoning in complex visual scenes, where intricate entities and relations require precise visual grounding at each step. This reasoning unfaithfulness frequently manifests as hallucinated entities, mis-grounded relations, skipped steps, and over-specified reasoning. Existing preference-based approaches, typically relying on textual perturbations or answer-conditioned rationales, fail to address this challenge as they allow models to exploit language priors to bypass visual grounding. To address this, we propose SceneAlign, a framework that leverages scene graphs as structured visual information to perform controllable structural interventions. By identifying reasoning-critical nodes and perturbing them through four targeted strategies that mimic typical grounding failures, SceneAlign constructs hard negative rationales that remain linguistically plausible but are grounded in inaccurate visual facts. These contrastive pairs are used in Direct Preference Optimization to steer models toward fine-grained, structure-faithful reasoning. Across seven visual reasoning benchmarks, SceneAlign consistently improves answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, highlighting the effectiveness of grounding-aware alignment for multimodal reasoning.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (methodological improvements to spatial understanding in multimodal reasoning) and criterion 2 (VLLMs/MLLMs). SceneAlign introduces a new framework for aligning multimodal reasoning to scene graphs, directly addressing spatial grounding and reasoning faithfulness in complex visual scenes.

## 3. [SketchVL: Policy Optimization via Fine-Grained Credit Assignment for Chart Understanding and More](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05688) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05688
**Authors:** Muye Huang, Lingling Zhang, Yifei Li, Yaqiang Wu, Jun Liu

**Abstract:**  Charts are high-density visual carriers of complex data and medium for information extraction and analysis. Due to the need for precise and complex visual reasoning, automated chart understanding poses a significant challenge to existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Many MLLMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) face the challenge of credit assignment. Their advantage estimation, typically performed at the trajectory level, cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps within a single generated response. To address this limitation, we introduce SketchVL, a novel MLLM that optimized with FinePO, a new RL algorithm designed for fine-grained credit assignment within each trajectory. SketchVL's methodology involves drawing its intermediate reasoning steps as markers on the image and feeding the annotated image back to itself, creating a robust, multi-step reasoning process. During training, the FinePO algorithm leverages a Fine-grained Process Reward Model (FinePRM) to score each drawing action within a trajectory, thereby precisely assigning credit for each step. This mechanism allows FinePO to more strongly reward correct tokens when a trajectory is globally successful, and more heavily penalize incorrect tokens when the trajectory is globally suboptimal, thus achieving fine-grained reinforcement signals. Experiments show that SketchVL learns to align its step-level behavior with the FinePRM, achieving an average performance gain of 7.23\% over its base model across chart datasets, natural image datasets, and mathematics, providing a promising new direction for training powerful reasoning models.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new MLLM, SketchVL, for chart understanding) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Also introduces a novel RL algorithm for fine-grained credit assignment, which is a clever statistical trick.

## 4. [LatentVLA: Efficient Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving via Latent Action Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05611) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05611
**Authors:** Chengen Xie, Bin Sun, Tianyu Li, Junjie Wu, Zhihui Hao, XianPeng Lang, Hongyang Li

**Abstract:**  End-to-end autonomous driving models trained on largescale datasets perform well in common scenarios but struggle with rare, long-tail situations due to limited scenario diversity. Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage broad knowledge from pre-trained visionlanguage models to address this limitation, yet face critical challenges: (1) numerical imprecision in trajectory prediction due to discrete tokenization, (2) heavy reliance on language annotations that introduce linguistic bias and annotation burden, and (3) computational inefficiency from multi-step chain-of-thought reasoning hinders real-time deployment. We propose LatentVLA, a novel framework that employs self-supervised latent action prediction to train VLA models without language annotations, eliminating linguistic bias while learning rich driving representations from unlabeled trajectory data. Through knowledge distillation, LatentVLA transfers the generalization capabilities of VLA models to efficient vision-based networks, achieving both robust performance and real-time efficiency. LatentVLA establishes a new state-of-the-art on the NAVSIM benchmark with a PDMS score of 92.4 and demonstrates strong zeroshot generalization on the nuScenes benchmark.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (efficient VLA model for autonomous driving, a new VLLM/MLLM) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and their application to autonomous driving). Also addresses spatial intelligence in embodied agents (criterion 1) via latent action prediction.

## 5. [FeatureSLAM: Feature-enriched 3D gaussian splatting SLAM in real time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05738) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05738
**Authors:** Christopher Thirgood, Oscar Mendez, Erin Ling, Jon Storey, Simon Hadfield

**Abstract:**  We present a real-time tracking SLAM system that unifies efficient camera tracking with photorealistic feature-enriched mapping using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our main contribution is integrating dense feature rasterization into the novel-view synthesis, aligned with a visual foundation model. This yields strong semantics, going beyond basic RGB-D input, aiding both tracking and mapping accuracy. Unlike previous semantic SLAM approaches (which embed pre-defined class labels) FeatureSLAM enables entirely new downstream tasks via free-viewpoint, open-set segmentation. Across standard benchmarks, our method achieves real-time tracking, on par with state-of-the-art systems while improving tracking stability and map fidelity without prohibitive compute. Quantitatively, we obtain 9\% lower pose error and 8\% higher mapping accuracy compared to recent fixed-set SLAM baselines. Our results confirm that real-time feature-embedded SLAM, is not only valuable for enabling new downstream applications. It also improves the performance of the underlying tracking and mapping subsystems, providing semantic and language masking results that are on-par with offline 3DGS models, alongside state-of-the-art tracking, depth and RGB rendering.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (spatial intelligence in embodied agents, as it improves SLAM with feature-enriched mapping) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models, as it aligns mapping with a visual foundation model). Also relevant to embodied AI (criterion 3) as it enables new downstream tasks in SLAM.

## 6. [Goal Force: Teaching Video Models To Accomplish Physics-Conditioned Goals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05848) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05848
**Authors:** Nate Gillman, Yinghua Zhou, Zitian Tang, Evan Luo, Arjan Chakravarthy, Daksh Aggarwal, Michael Freeman, Charles Herrmann, Chen Sun

**Abstract:**  Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the development of ``world models'' capable of simulating potential futures for robotics and planning. However, specifying precise goals for these models remains a challenge; text instructions are often too abstract to capture physical nuances, while target images are frequently infeasible to specify for dynamic tasks. To address this, we introduce Goal Force, a novel framework that allows users to define goals via explicit force vectors and intermediate dynamics, mirroring how humans conceptualize physical tasks. We train a video generation model on a curated dataset of synthetic causal primitives-such as elastic collisions and falling dominos-teaching it to propagate forces through time and space. Despite being trained on simple physics data, our model exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to complex, real-world scenarios, including tool manipulation and multi-object causal chains. Our results suggest that by grounding video generation in fundamental physical interactions, models can emerge as implicit neural physics simulators, enabling precise, physics-aware planning without reliance on external engines. We release all datasets, code, model weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (embodied AI, new method for goal specification in video world models for planning and robotics, with a novel angle: specifying goals via force vectors rather than text or images). Also relevant to generative modeling in multi-modal learning.

## 7. [VIB-Probe: Detecting and Mitigating Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models via Variational Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05547) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05547
**Authors:** Feiran Zhang, Yixin Wu, Zhenghua Wang, Xiaohua Wang, Changze Lv, Xuanjing Huang, Xiaoqing Zheng

**Abstract:**  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, but remain susceptible to hallucinations, where generated text deviates from the underlying visual content. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily rely on output logits or external verification tools, often overlooking their internal mechanisms. In this work, we investigate the outputs of internal attention heads, postulating that specific heads carry the primary signals for truthful generation.However, directly probing these high-dimensional states is challenging due to the entanglement of visual-linguistic syntax and noise. To address this, we propose VIB-Probe, a novel hallucination detection and mitigation framework leveraging the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) theory. Our method extracts discriminative patterns across layers and heads while filtering out semantic nuisances through the information bottleneck principle. Furthermore, by leveraging the gradients of our VIB probe, we identify attention heads with strong causal influence on hallucinations and introduce an inference-time intervention strategy for hallucination mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that VIB-Probe significantly outperforms existing baselines in both settings. Our code will be made publicly available.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (VLLMs/MLLMs). Proposes a novel hallucination detection and mitigation framework for vision-language models using the variational information bottleneck, with a new inference-time intervention strategy.

## 8. [Context-Aware Decoding for Faithful Vision-Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05939) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05939
**Authors:** Mehrdad Fazli, Bowen Wei, Ziwei Zhu

**Abstract:**  Hallucinations, generating responses inconsistent with the visual input, remain a critical limitation of large vision-language models (LVLMs), especially in open-ended tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we probe the layer-wise generation dynamics that drive hallucinations and propose a training-free mitigation strategy. Employing the Logit Lens, we examine how LVLMs construct next-token distributions across decoder layers, uncovering a pronounced commitment-depth gap: truthful tokens accumulate probability mass on their final candidates earlier than hallucinatory ones. Drawing on this discovery, we introduce Context Embedding Injection (CEI), a lightweight method that harnesses the hidden state of the last input token-the context embedding-as a grounding signal to maintain visual fidelity throughout decoding and curb hallucinations. Evaluated on the CHAIR, AMBER, and MMHal-Bench benchmarks (with a maximum token length of 512), CEI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three LVLMs, with its dynamic variant yielding the lowest overall hallucination rates. By integrating novel mechanistic insights with a scalable intervention, this work advances the mitigation of hallucinations in LVLMs.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (VLLMs/MLLMs). Proposes a new, training-free method to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs using context embedding injection, with novel mechanistic insights into generation dynamics.

## 9. [PII-VisBench: Evaluating Personally Identifiable Information Safety in Vision Language Models Along a Continuum of Visibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05739) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05739
**Authors:** G M Shahariar, Zabir Al Nazi, Md Olid Hasan Bhuiyan, Zhouxing Shi

**Abstract:**  Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly integrated into privacy-critical domains, yet existing evaluations of personally identifiable information (PII) leakage largely treat privacy as a static extraction task and ignore how a subject's online presence--the volume of their data available online--influences privacy alignment. We introduce PII-VisBench, a novel benchmark containing 4000 unique probes designed to evaluate VLM safety through the continuum of online presence. The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities. Finally, paraphrasing and jailbreak-style prompts expose attack and model-dependent failures, motivating visibility-aware safety evaluation and training interventions.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (evaluates VLLMs for PII safety, introduces a new benchmark for vision-language models). Also relevant to surprising empirical results in VLLMs.

## 10. [Enabling Stroke-Level Structural Analysis of Hieroglyphic Scripts without Language-Specific Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05508) <a id="link10"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05508
**Authors:** Fuwen Luo, Zihao Wan, Ziyue Wang, Yaluo Liu, Pau Tong Lin Xu, Xuanjia Qiao, Xiaolong Wang, Peng Li, Yang Liu

**Abstract:**  Hieroglyphs, as logographic writing systems, encode rich semantic and cultural information within their internal structural composition. Yet, current advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) usually remain structurally blind to this information. LLMs process characters as textual tokens, while MLLMs additionally view them as raw pixel grids. Both fall short to model the underlying logic of character strokes. Furthermore, existing structural analysis methods are often script-specific and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose Hieroglyphic Stroke Analyzer (HieroSA), a novel and generalizable framework that enables MLLMs to automatically derive stroke-level structures from character bitmaps without handcrafted data. It transforms modern logographic and ancient hieroglyphs character images into explicit, interpretable line-segment representations in a normalized coordinate space, allowing for cross-lingual generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HieroSA effectively captures character-internal structures and semantics, bypassing the need for language-specific priors. Experimental results highlight the potential of our work as a graphematics analysis tool for a deeper understanding of hieroglyphic scripts. View our code at https://github.com/THUNLP-MT/HieroSA.

**Comment:** This paper introduces HieroSA, a framework enabling MLLMs to analyze stroke-level structure in hieroglyphic scripts without language-specific priors. It is a new method for MLLMs (criterion 2), and also relates to vision foundation models (criterion 4).

## 11. [Boosting Latent Diffusion Models via Disentangled Representation Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05823) <a id="link11"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05823
**Authors:** John Page, Xuesong Niu, Kai Wu, Kun Gai

**Abstract:**  Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) generate high-quality images by operating in a compressed latent space, typically obtained through image tokenizers such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In pursuit of a generation-friendly VAE, recent studies have explored leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as representation alignment targets for VAEs, mirroring the approach commonly adopted for LDMs. Although this yields certain performance gains, using the same alignment target for both VAEs and LDMs overlooks their fundamentally different representational requirements. We advocate that while LDMs benefit from latents retaining high-level semantic concepts, VAEs should excel in semantic disentanglement, enabling encoding of attribute-level information in a structured way. To address this, we propose the Semantic disentangled VAE (Send-VAE), explicitly optimized for disentangled representation learning through aligning its latent space with the semantic hierarchy of pre-trained VFMs. Our approach employs a non-linear mapper network to transform VAE latents, aligning them with VFMs to bridge the gap between attribute-level disentanglement and high-level semantics, facilitating effective guidance for VAE learning. We evaluate semantic disentanglement via linear probing on attribute prediction tasks, showing strong correlation with improved generation performance. Finally, using Send-VAE, we train flow-based transformers SiTs; experiments show Send-VAE significantly speeds up training and achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.21 and 1.75 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256x256.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Proposes a new VAE training method using semantic disentanglement aligned with vision foundation models, and demonstrates improved generative modeling. Also relevant to generative modeling in multi-modal learning.

## 12. [MOSAIC-GS: Monocular Scene Reconstruction via Advanced Initialization for Complex Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05368) <a id="link12"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05368
**Authors:** Svitlana Morkva, Maximum Wilder-Smith, Michael Oechsle, Alessio Tonioni, Marco Hutter, Vaishakh Patil

**Abstract:**  We present MOSAIC-GS, a novel, fully explicit, and computationally efficient approach for high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular videos using Gaussian Splatting. Monocular reconstruction is inherently ill-posed due to the lack of sufficient multiview constraints, making accurate recovery of object geometry and temporal coherence particularly challenging. To address this, we leverage multiple geometric cues, such as depth, optical flow, dynamic object segmentation, and point tracking. Combined with rigidity-based motion constraints, these cues allow us to estimate preliminary 3D scene dynamics during an initialization stage. Recovering scene dynamics prior to the photometric optimization reduces reliance on motion inference from visual appearance alone, which is often ambiguous in monocular settings. To enable compact representations, fast training, and real-time rendering while supporting non-rigid deformations, the scene is decomposed into static and dynamic components. Each Gaussian in the dynamic part of the scene is assigned a trajectory represented as time-dependent Poly-Fourier curve for parameter-efficient motion encoding. We demonstrate that MOSAIC-GS achieves substantially faster optimization and rendering compared to existing methods, while maintaining reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art approaches across standard monocular dynamic scene benchmarks.

**Comment:** MOSAIC-GS presents a new method for monocular scene reconstruction in dynamic environments, using multiple geometric cues and Gaussian Splatting. The explicit modeling of scene dynamics and spatial cues is a methodological improvement in spatial understanding (criterion 1), and the approach is relevant for embodied AI.

## 13. [TAPM-Net: Trajectory-Aware Perturbation Modeling for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05446) <a id="link13"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05446
**Authors:** Hongyang Xie, Hongyang He, Victor Sanchez

**Abstract:**  Infrared small target detection (ISTD) remains a long-standing challenge due to weak signal contrast, limited spatial extent, and cluttered backgrounds. Despite performance improvements from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), current models lack a mechanism to trace how small targets trigger directional, layer-wise perturbations in the feature space, which is an essential cue for distinguishing signal from structured noise in infrared scenes. To address this limitation, we propose the Trajectory-Aware Mamba Propagation Network (TAPM-Net), which explicitly models the spatial diffusion behavior of target-induced feature disturbances. TAPM-Net is built upon two novel components: a Perturbation-guided Path Module (PGM) and a Trajectory-Aware State Block (TASB). The PGM constructs perturbation energy fields from multi-level features and extracts gradient-following feature trajectories that reflect the directionality of local responses. The resulting feature trajectories are fed into the TASB, a Mamba-based state-space unit that models dynamic propagation along each trajectory while incorporating velocity-constrained diffusion and semantically aligned feature fusion from word-level and sentence-level embeddings. Unlike existing attention-based methods, TAPM-Net enables anisotropic, context-sensitive state transitions along spatial trajectories while maintaining global coherence at low computational cost. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1K demonstrate that TAPM-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in ISTD.

**Comment:** This paper introduces TAPM-Net, which models spatial diffusion behavior of target-induced feature disturbances for infrared small target detection. The explicit modeling of spatial trajectories and anisotropic, context-sensitive state transitions is a methodological improvement in spatial understanding (criterion 1).

## 14. [MoGen: A Unified Collaborative Framework for Controllable Multi-Object Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05546) <a id="link14"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05546
**Authors:** Yanfeng Li, Yue Sun, Keren Fu, Sio-Kei Im, Xiaoming Liu, Guangtao Zhai, Xiaohong Liu, Tao Tan

**Abstract:**  Existing multi-object image generation methods face difficulties in achieving precise alignment between localized image generation regions and their corresponding semantics based on language descriptions, frequently resulting in inconsistent object quantities and attribute aliasing. To mitigate this limitation, mainstream approaches typically rely on external control signals to explicitly constrain the spatial layout, local semantic and visual attributes of images. However, this strong dependency makes the input format rigid, rendering it incompatible with the heterogeneous resource conditions of users and diverse constraint requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MoGen, a user-friendly multi-object image generation method. First, we design a Regional Semantic Anchor (RSA) module that precisely anchors phrase units in language descriptions to their corresponding image regions during the generation process, enabling text-to-image generation that follows quantity specifications for multiple objects. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce an Adaptive Multi-modal Guidance (AMG) module, which adaptively parses and integrates various combinations of multi-source control signals to formulate corresponding structured intent. This intent subsequently guides selective constraints on scene layouts and object attributes, achieving dynamic fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that MoGen significantly outperforms existing methods in generation quality, quantity consistency, and fine-grained control, while exhibiting superior accessibility and control flexibility. Code is available at: https://github.com/Tear-kitty/MoGen/tree/master.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications, as it proposes a new multi-object image generation framework with fine-grained control using multi-modal guidance). Also relevant to generative modeling in multi-modal learning.

**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05470
**Authors:** Tingwei Xie, Jinxin He, Yonghong Song

**Abstract:**  The efficacy of Multimodal Transformers in visually-rich document understanding (VrDU) is critically constrained by two inherent limitations: the lack of explicit modeling for logical reading order and the interference of visual tokens that dilutes attention on textual semantics.   To address these challenges, this paper presents ROAP, a lightweight and architecture-agnostic pipeline designed to optimize attention distributions in Layout Transformers without altering their pre-trained backbones.   The proposed pipeline first employs an Adaptive-XY-Gap (AXG-Tree) to robustly extract hierarchical reading sequences from complex layouts. These sequences are then integrated into the attention mechanism via a Reading-Order-Aware Relative Position Bias (RO-RPB). Furthermore, a Textual-Token Sub-block Attention Prior (TT-Prior) is introduced to adaptively suppress visual noise and enhance fine-grained text-text interactions.   Extensive experiments on the FUNSD and CORD benchmarks demonstrate that ROAP consistently improves the performance of representative backbones, including LayoutLMv3 and GeoLayoutLM.   These findings confirm that explicitly modeling reading logic and regulating modality interference are critical for robust document understanding, offering a scalable solution for complex layout analysis. The implementation code will be released at https://github.com/KevinYuLei/ROAP.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (methodological improvements to spatial understanding in document layout transformers) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications, as it builds on LayoutLMv3 and GeoLayoutLM). The paper proposes a new pipeline for better spatial reasoning in visually-rich document understanding.

## 16. [Multi-task Cross-modal Learning for Chest X-ray Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05399) <a id="link16"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05399
**Authors:** Zhaohui Liang, Sivaramakrishnan Rajaraman, Niccolo Marini, Zhiyun Xue, Sameer Antani

**Abstract:**  CLIP and BiomedCLIP are examples of vision-language foundation models and offer strong cross-modal embeddings; however, they are not optimized for fine-grained medical retrieval tasks, such as retrieving clinically relevant radiology reports using chest X-ray (CXR) image queries. To address this shortcoming, we propose a multi-task learning framework to fine-tune BiomedCLIP and evaluate improvements to CXR image-text retrieval. Using BiomedCLIP as the backbone, we incorporate a lightweight MLP projector head trained with a multi-task composite loss function that includes: (1) a binary cross-entropy loss to distinguish normal from abnormal CXR studies, (2) a supervised contrastive loss to reinforce intra-class consistency, and (3) a CLIP loss to maintain cross-modal alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves more balanced and clinically meaningful performance across both image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks compared to the pretrained BiomedCLIP and general-purpose CLIP models. Furthermore, t-SNE visualizations reveal clearer semantic clustering of normal and abnormal cases, demonstrating the model's enhanced diagnostic sensitivity. These findings highlight the value of domain-adaptive, multi-task learning for advancing cross-modal retrieval in biomedical applications.

**Comment:** This paper fine-tunes BiomedCLIP (a vision-language foundation model) for improved cross-modal retrieval in medical imaging, which matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications).

## 17. [One Language-Free Foundation Model Is Enough for Universal Vision Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05552) <a id="link17"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05552
**Authors:** Bin-Bin Gao, Chengjie Wang

**Abstract:**  Universal visual anomaly detection (AD) aims to identify anomaly images and segment anomaly regions towards open and dynamic scenarios, following zero- and few-shot paradigms without any dataset-specific fine-tuning. We have witnessed significant progress in widely use of visual-language foundational models in recent approaches. However, current methods often struggle with complex prompt engineering, elaborate adaptation modules, and challenging training strategies, ultimately limiting their flexibility and generality. To address these issues, this paper rethinks the fundamental mechanism behind visual-language models for AD and presents an embarrassingly simple, general, and effective framework for Universal vision Anomaly Detection (UniADet). Specifically, we first find language encoder is used to derive decision weights for anomaly classification and segmentation, and then demonstrate that it is unnecessary for universal AD. Second, we propose an embarrassingly simple method to completely decouple classification and segmentation, and decouple cross-level features, i.e., learning independent weights for different tasks and hierarchical features. UniADet is highly simple (learning only decoupled weights), parameter-efficient (only 0.002M learnable parameters), general (adapting a variety of foundation models), and effective (surpassing state-of-the-art zero-/few-shot by a large margin and even full-shot AD methods for the first time) on 14 real-world AD benchmarks covering both industrial and medical domains. We will make the code and model of UniADet available at https://github.com/gaobb/UniADet.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Proposes a simple, language-free method for universal anomaly detection using vision foundation models, with strong empirical results.

## 18. [GaussianSwap: Animatable Video Face Swapping with 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05511) <a id="link18"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05511
**Authors:** Xuan Cheng, Jiahao Rao, Chengyang Li, Wenhao Wang, Weilin Chen, Lvqing Yang

**Abstract:**  We introduce GaussianSwap, a novel video face swapping framework that constructs a 3D Gaussian Splatting based face avatar from a target video while transferring identity from a source image to the avatar. Conventional video swapping frameworks are limited to generating facial representations in pixel-based formats. The resulting swapped faces exist merely as a set of unstructured pixels without any capacity for animation or interactive manipulation. Our work introduces a paradigm shift from conventional pixel-based video generation to the creation of high-fidelity avatar with swapped faces. The framework first preprocesses target video to extract FLAME parameters, camera poses and segmentation masks, and then rigs 3D Gaussian splats to the FLAME model across frames, enabling dynamic facial control. To ensure identity preserving, we propose an compound identity embedding constructed from three state-of-the-art face recognition models for avatar finetuning. Finally, we render the face-swapped avatar on the background frames to obtain the face-swapped video. Experimental results demonstrate that GaussianSwap achieves superior identity preservation, visual clarity and temporal consistency, while enabling previously unattainable interactive applications.

**Comment:** GaussianSwap introduces a 3D Gaussian Splatting-based framework for animatable video face swapping, moving from pixel-based to 3D avatar-based representations. While innovative in generative modeling and vision, it does not directly match the criteria of spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

## 19. [PRISMA: Reinforcement Learning Guided Two-Stage Policy Optimization in Multi-Agent Architecture for Open-Domain Multi-Hop Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05465) <a id="link19"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05465
**Authors:** Yu Liu, Wenxiao Zhang, Cong Cao, Wenxuan Lu, Fangfang Yuan, Diandian Guo, Kun Peng, Qiang Sun, Kaiyan Zhang, Yanbing Liu, Jin B. Hong, Bowen Zhou, Zhiyuan Ma

**Abstract:**  Answering real-world open-domain multi-hop questions over massive corpora is a critical challenge in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Recent research employs reinforcement learning (RL) to end-to-end optimize the retrieval-augmented reasoning process, directly enhancing its capacity to resolve complex queries. However, reliable deployment is hindered by two obstacles. 1) Retrieval Collapse: iterative retrieval over large corpora fails to locate intermediate evidence containing bridge answers without reasoning-guided planning, causing downstream reasoning to collapse. 2) Learning Instability: end-to-end trajectory training suffers from weak credit assignment across reasoning chains and poor error localization across modules, causing overfitting to benchmark-specific heuristics that limit transferability and stability. To address these problems, we propose PRISMA, a decoupled RL-guided framework featuring a Plan-Retrieve-Inspect-Solve-Memoize architecture. PRISMA's strength lies in reasoning-guided collaboration: the Inspector provides reasoning-based feedback to refine the Planner's decomposition and fine-grained retrieval, while enforcing evidence-grounded reasoning in the Solver. We optimize individual agent capabilities via Two-Stage Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Stage I calibrates the Planner and Solver as specialized experts in planning and reasoning, while Stage II utilizes Observation-Aware Residual Policy Optimization (OARPO) to enhance the Inspector's ability to verify context and trigger targeted recovery. Experiments show that PRISMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten benchmarks and can be deployed efficiently in real-world scenarios.

**Comment:** This paper introduces PRISMA, a multi-agent RL-guided framework for open-domain multi-hop question answering. While it features multi-agent architecture and RL, it is focused on text-based QA and not on spatial intelligence, embodied agents, VLLMs/MLLMs, or vision foundation models.

## 20. [EdgeLDR: Quaternion Low-Displacement Rank Neural Networks for Edge-Efficient Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05379) <a id="link20"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05379
**Authors:** Vladimir Frants, Sos Agaian, Karen Panetta

**Abstract:**  Deploying deep neural networks on edge devices is often limited by the memory traffic and compute cost of dense linear operators. While quaternion neural networks improve parameter efficiency by coupling multiple channels through Hamilton products, they typically retain unstructured dense weights; conversely, structured matrices enable fast computation but are usually applied in the real domain. This paper introduces EdgeLDR, a practical framework for quaternion block-circulant linear and convolutional layers that combines quaternion channel mixing with block-circulant parameter structure and enables FFT-based evaluation through the complex adjoint representation. We present reference implementations of EdgeLDR layers and compare FFT-based computation against a naive spatial-domain realization of quaternion circulant products. FFT evaluation yields large empirical speedups over the naive implementation and keeps latency stable as block size increases, making larger compression factors computationally viable. We further integrate EdgeLDR layers into compact CNN and Transformer backbones and evaluate accuracy-compression trade-offs on 32x32 RGB classification (CIFAR-10/100, SVHN) and hyperspectral image classification (Houston 2013, Pavia University), reporting parameter counts and CPU/GPU latency. The results show that EdgeLDR layers provide significant compression with competitive accuracy.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a new method for efficient neural networks using quaternion block-circulant layers and FFT-based computation, which is a methodological improvement in model compression and efficiency. However, it does not directly address spatial understanding or embodied agents, nor does it focus on vision foundation models or VLLMs/MLLMs.

## 21. [CHDP: Cooperative Hybrid Diffusion Policies for Reinforcement Learning in Parameterized Action Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05675) <a id="link21"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05675
**Authors:** Bingyi Liu, Jinbo He, Haiyong Shi, Enshu Wang, Weizhen Han, Jingxiang Hao, Peixi Wang, Zhuangzhuang Zhang

**Abstract:**  Hybrid action space, which combines discrete choices and continuous parameters, is prevalent in domains such as robot control and game AI. However, efficiently modeling and optimizing hybrid discrete-continuous action space remains a fundamental challenge, mainly due to limited policy expressiveness and poor scalability in high-dimensional settings. To address this challenge, we view the hybrid action space problem as a fully cooperative game and propose a \textbf{Cooperative Hybrid Diffusion Policies (CHDP)} framework to solve it. CHDP employs two cooperative agents that leverage a discrete and a continuous diffusion policy, respectively. The continuous policy is conditioned on the discrete action's representation, explicitly modeling the dependency between them. This cooperative design allows the diffusion policies to leverage their expressiveness to capture complex distributions in their respective action spaces. To mitigate the update conflicts arising from simultaneous policy updates in this cooperative setting, we employ a sequential update scheme that fosters co-adaptation. Moreover, to improve scalability when learning in high-dimensional discrete action space, we construct a codebook that embeds the action space into a low-dimensional latent space. This mapping enables the discrete policy to learn in a compact, structured space. Finally, we design a Q-function-based guidance mechanism to align the codebook's embeddings with the discrete policy's representation during training. On challenging hybrid action benchmarks, CHDP outperforms the state-of-the-art method by up to $19.3\%$ in success rate.

**Comment:** Relevant to RL in hybrid action spaces, but does not directly address spatial intelligence, embodied AI benchmarks, or vision foundation models. No direct match to the listed criteria.

## 22. [Semi-Supervised Facial Expression Recognition based on Dynamic Threshold and Negative Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05556) <a id="link22"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05556
**Authors:** Zhongpeng Cai, Jun Yu, Wei Xu, Tianyu Liu, Jianqing Sun, Jiaen Liang

**Abstract:**  Facial expression recognition is a key task in human-computer interaction and affective computing. However, acquiring a large amount of labeled facial expression data is often costly. Therefore, it is particularly important to design a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm that makes full use of both labeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm based on Dynamic Threshold Adjustment (DTA) and Selective Negative Learning (SNL). Initially, we designed strategies for local attention enhancement and random dropout of feature maps during feature extraction, which strengthen the representation of local features while ensuring the model does not overfit to any specific local area. Furthermore, this study introduces a dynamic thresholding method to adapt to the requirements of the semi-supervised learning framework for facial expression recognition tasks, and through a selective negative learning strategy, it fully utilizes unlabeled samples with low confidence by mining useful expression information from complementary labels, achieving impressive results. We have achieved state-of-the-art performance on the RAF-DB and AffectNet datasets. Our method surpasses fully supervised methods even without using the entire dataset, which proves the effectiveness of our approach.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a semi-supervised facial expression recognition method with dynamic thresholding and negative learning. While it is a methodological improvement in vision, it does not match the specific criteria of spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05256
**Authors:** Eirini Baltzi, Tilemachos Moumouris, Athena Psalta, Vasileios Tsironis, Konstantinos Karantzalos

**Abstract:**  Inland water monitoring is vital for safeguarding public health and ecosystems, enabling timely interventions to mitigate risks. Existing methods often address isolated sub-problems such as cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, or other quality indicators separately. NAIAD introduces an agentic AI assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and external analytical tools to deliver a holistic solution for inland water monitoring using Earth Observation (EO) data. Designed for both experts and non-experts, NAIAD provides a single-prompt interface that translates natural-language queries into actionable insights. Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM reasoning, external tool orchestration, computational graph execution, and agentic reflection, it retrieves and synthesizes knowledge from curated sources to produce tailored reports. The system integrates diverse tools for weather data, Sentinel-2 imagery, remote-sensing index computation (e.g., NDCI), chlorophyll-a estimation, and established platforms such as CyFi. Performance is evaluated using correctness and relevancy metrics, achieving over 77% and 85% respectively on a dedicated benchmark covering multiple user-expertise levels. Preliminary results show strong adaptability and robustness across query types. An ablation study on LLM backbones further highlights Gemma 3 (27B) and Qwen 2.5 (14B) as offering the best balance between computational efficiency and reasoning performance.

**Comment:** NAIAD is an agentic AI assistant for inland water monitoring using LLMs and external tools, integrating EO data and various analytical modules. While it leverages LLMs and agentic reasoning, it is not focused on spatial intelligence for embodied agents, VLLMs/MLLMs, or vision foundation models in a way that matches the criteria.

## 24. [Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction for Semi-Supervised Medical Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05855) <a id="link24"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05855
**Authors:** Kaiwen Huang, Yizhe Zhang, Yi Zhou, Tianyang Xu, Tao Zhou

**Abstract:**  Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is an effective method for addressing scenarios with limited labeled data. Existing methods mainly rely on frameworks such as mean teacher and dual-stream consistency learning. These approaches often face issues like error accumulation and model structural complexity, while also neglecting the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data streams. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction~(BCSI) framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. First, we propose a Semantic-Spatial Perturbation~(SSP) mechanism, which disturbs the data using two strong augmentation operations and leverages unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels from weak augmentations. Additionally, we employ consistency on the predictions from the two strong augmentations to further improve model stability and robustness. Second, to reduce noise during the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a Channel-selective Router~(CR) component, which dynamically selects the most relevant channels for information exchange. This mechanism ensures that only highly relevant features are activated, minimizing unnecessary interference. Finally, the Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction~(BCI) strategy is employed to supplement additional semantic information and enhance the representation of important channels. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking 3D medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches.

**Comment:** This is a semi-supervised medical segmentation paper with new channel-wise interaction mechanisms. While relevant to computer vision, it does not match the specific criteria.

## 25. [Phase4DFD: Multi-Domain Phase-Aware Attention for Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05861) <a id="link25"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05861
**Authors:** Zhen-Xin Lin, Shang-Kuan Chen

**Abstract:**  Recent deepfake detection methods have increasingly explored frequency domain representations to reveal manipulation artifacts that are difficult to detect in the spatial domain. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on spectral magnitude, implicitly under exploring the role of phase information. In this work, we propose Phase4DFD, a phase aware frequency domain deepfake detection framework that explicitly models phase magnitude interactions via a learnable attention mechanism. Our approach augments standard RGB input with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) magnitude and local binary pattern (LBP) representations to expose subtle synthesis artifacts that remain indistinguishable under spatial analysis alone. Crucially, we introduce an input level phase aware attention module that uses phase discontinuities commonly introduced by synthetic generation to guide the model toward frequency patterns that are most indicative of manipulation before backbone feature extraction. The attended multi domain representation is processed by an efficient BNext M backbone, with optional channel spatial attention applied for semantic feature refinement. Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE and DFFD datasets demonstrate that our proposed model Phase4DFD outperforms state of the art spatial and frequency-based detectors while maintaining low computational overhead. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm that explicit phase modeling provides complementary and non-redundant information beyond magnitude-only frequency representations.

**Comment:** This paper is about deepfake detection using phase-aware attention in the frequency domain. While it is a vision paper, it does not match any of the specific criteria.

**ArXiv ID:** 2601.05535
**Authors:** Qiwei Yang, Pingping Zhang, Yuhao Wang, Zijing Gong

**Abstract:**  Video-based Person Re-IDentification (VPReID) aims to retrieve the same person from videos captured by non-overlapping cameras. At extreme far distances, VPReID is highly challenging due to severe resolution degradation, drastic viewpoint variation and inevitable appearance noise. To address these issues, we propose a Scale-Adaptive framework with Shape Priors for VPReID, named SAS-VPReID. The framework is built upon three complementary modules. First, we deploy a Memory-Enhanced Visual Backbone (MEVB) to extract discriminative feature representations, which leverages the CLIP vision encoder and multi-proxy memory. Second, we propose a Multi-Granularity Temporal Modeling (MGTM) to construct sequences at multiple temporal granularities and adaptively emphasize motion cues across scales. Third, we incorporate Prior-Regularized Shape Dynamics (PRSD) to capture body structure dynamics. With these modules, our framework can obtain more discriminative feature representations. Experiments on the VReID-XFD benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of each module and our final framework ranks the first on the VReID-XFD challenge leaderboard. The source code is available at https://github.com/YangQiWei3/SAS-VPReID.

**Comment:** This paper is about person re-identification at far distances using CLIP as a backbone, but does not introduce new VLLMs/MLLMs or spatial intelligence for embodied agents. It is relevant to computer vision but not to the specific criteria.
