## 0. [SAM 3: Segment Anything with Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16719) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.16719
**Authors:** Nicolas Carion, Laura Gustafson, Yuan-Ting Hu, Shoubhik Debnath, Ronghang Hu, Didac Suris, Chaitanya Ryali, Kalyan Vasudev Alwala, Haitham Khedr, Andrew Huang, Jie Lei, Tengyu Ma, Baishan Guo, Arpit Kalla, Markus Marks, Joseph Greer, Meng Wang, Peize Sun, Roman R\"adle, Triantafyllos Afouras, Effrosyni Mavroudi, Katherine Xu, Tsung-Han Wu, Yu Zhou, Liliane Momeni, Rishi Hazra, Shuangrui Ding, Sagar Vaze, Francois Porcher, Feng Li, Siyuan Li, Aishwarya Kamath, Ho Kei Cheng, Piotr Doll\'ar, Nikhila Ravi, Kate Saenko, Pengchuan Zhang, Christoph Feichtenhofer

**Abstract:**  We present Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3, a unified model that detects, segments, and tracks objects in images and videos based on concept prompts, which we define as either short noun phrases (e.g., "yellow school bus"), image exemplars, or a combination of both. Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) takes such prompts and returns segmentation masks and unique identities for all matching object instances. To advance PCS, we build a scalable data engine that produces a high-quality dataset with 4M unique concept labels, including hard negatives, across images and videos. Our model consists of an image-level detector and a memory-based video tracker that share a single backbone. Recognition and localization are decoupled with a presence head, which boosts detection accuracy. SAM 3 doubles the accuracy of existing systems in both image and video PCS, and improves previous SAM capabilities on visual segmentation tasks. We open source SAM 3 along with our new Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co) benchmark for promptable concept segmentation.

**Comment:** Directly matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) and is highly relevant to your friend's interests. Introduces SAM 3, a major new version of the Segment Anything Model, with a new benchmark and strong empirical results.

## 1. [R-AVST: Empowering Video-LLMs with Fine-Grained Spatio-Temporal Reasoning in Complex Audio-Visual Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16901) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.16901
**Authors:** Lu Zhu, Tiantian Geng, Yangye Chen, Teng Wang, Ping Lu, Feng Zheng

**Abstract:**  Recently, rapid advancements have been made in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially in video understanding tasks. However, current research focuses on simple video scenarios, failing to reflect the complex and diverse nature of real-world audio-visual events in videos. To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, R-AVST is the first dataset designed for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero offers a novel perspective for tackling future challenges in this domain.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3: Introduces a new benchmark (R-AVST) for audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning and a new RL-based model (AVST-Zero) for embodied AI in complex video scenarios. Focuses on aspects previously ignored (fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations).

## 2. [UniModel: A Visual-Only Framework for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16917) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.16917
**Authors:** Chi Zhang, Jiepeng Wang, Youming Wang, Yuanzhi Liang, Xiaoyan Yang, Zuoxin Li, Haibin Huang, Xuelong Li

**Abstract:**  We present UniModel, a unified generative model that jointly supports visual understanding and visual generation within a single pixel-to-pixel diffusion framework. Our goal is to achieve unification along three axes: the model, the tasks, and the representations. At the representation level, we eliminate modality discrepancies by mapping both text and images into a shared visual space: textual prompts are rendered as painted text images on a clean canvas, and all inputs and outputs are treated purely as RGB pixels. This yields a fully vision-native formulation of multimodal learning. At the task level, a broad range of vision-language problems are cast as pixel-to-pixel transformations in this visual space. For understanding tasks, the model takes an RGB image and produces a painted text image that visually encodes the semantic prediction. For generation tasks, painted text images serve as visual conditions that guide realistic and semantically aligned image synthesis. Captioning and text-to-image generation thus become different directions of the same underlying visual translation process. At the model level, we instantiate a single Unified Diffusion Transformer trained with rectified flow in pixel space. A shared backbone jointly learns bidirectional mappings between natural images and painted text images, with lightweight task embeddings to specify the desired direction. Experiments on text-to-image synthesis and image-to-text understanding demonstrate strong cross-modal alignment and emergent controllability such as cycle-consistent image-caption-image loops. Our initial exploration suggests that unifying model, tasks, and representations in a single visual space is a promising paradigm for general-purpose multimodal intelligence.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new VLLMs/MLLMs): UniModel is a unified generative model for both visual understanding and generation, using a vision-only, pixel-to-pixel diffusion framework for multimodal learning. Also matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications).

## 3. [Designing Domain-Specific Agents via Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17198) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17198
**Authors:** Kaiyu Li, Jiayu Wang, Zhi Wang, Hui Qiao, Weizhan Zhang, Deyu Meng, Xiangyong Cao

**Abstract:**  LLM-driven agents, particularly those using general frameworks like ReAct or human-inspired role-playing, often struggle in specialized domains that necessitate rigorously structured workflows. Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3: Proposes a new hierarchical task abstraction mechanism for domain-specific embodied agents, introduces a new benchmark (GeoPlan-bench) for geospatial planning, and demonstrates improved planning in complex domains.

## 4. [OmniGround: A Comprehensive Spatio-Temporal Grounding Benchmark for Real-World Complex Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16937) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.16937
**Authors:** Hong Gao, Jingyu Wu, Xiangkai Xu, Kangni Xie, Yunchen Zhang, Bin Zhong, Xurui Gao, Min-Ling Zhang

**Abstract:**  Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize target objects in videos based on natural language descriptions. Despite recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models, a significant gap remains between current models and real-world demands involving diverse objects and complex queries. We attribute this to limited benchmark scope, causing models to exhibit category bias, oversimplified reasoning, and poor linguistic robustness. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniGround, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,475 videos spanning 81 categories and complex real-world queries. We propose the Forward-Backward-Refinement annotation pipeline that combines multi-directional tracking with intelligent error correction for high-quality labels. We further introduce DeepSTG, a systematic evaluation framework quantifying dataset quality across four complementary dimensions beyond superficial statistics. Evaluations reveal performance average drop of 10.4% on complex real-world scenes, particularly with small/occluded objects and intricate spatial relations. Motivated by these, we propose PG-TAF, a training-free two-stage framework decomposing STVG into high-level temporal grounding and fine-grained spatio-temporal propagation. Experiments demonstrate PG-TAF achieves 25.6% and 35.6% improvements in m\_tIoU and m\_vIoU on OmniGround with consistent gains across four benchmarks.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (embodied AI, new benchmark): Introduces OmniGround, a comprehensive spatio-temporal grounding benchmark for real-world scenarios, and proposes a new annotation pipeline and evaluation framework. Also proposes a new method (PG-TAF) for STVG.

## 5. [WorldGen: From Text to Traversable and Interactive 3D Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16825) <a id="link5"></a>

**Authors:** Dilin Wang, Hyunyoung Jung, Tom Monnier, Kihyuk Sohn, Chuhang Zou, Xiaoyu Xiang, Yu-Ying Yeh, Di Liu, Zixuan Huang, Thu Nguyen-Phuoc, Yuchen Fan, Sergiu Oprea, Ziyan Wang, Roman Shapovalov, Nikolaos Sarafianos, Thibault Groueix, Antoine Toisoul, Prithviraj Dhar, Xiao Chu, Minghao Chen, Geon Yeong Park, Mahima Gupta, Yassir Azziz, Rakesh Ranjan, Andrea Vedaldi

**Abstract:**  We introduce WorldGen, a system that enables the automatic creation of large-scale, interactive 3D worlds directly from text prompts. Our approach transforms natural language descriptions into traversable, fully textured environments that can be immediately explored or edited within standard game engines. By combining LLM-driven scene layout reasoning, procedural generation, diffusion-based 3D generation, and object-aware scene decomposition, WorldGen bridges the gap between creative intent and functional virtual spaces, allowing creators to design coherent, navigable worlds without manual modeling or specialized 3D expertise. The system is fully modular and supports fine-grained control over layout, scale, and style, producing worlds that are geometrically consistent, visually rich, and efficient to render in real time. This work represents a step towards accessible, generative world-building at scale, advancing the frontier of 3D generative AI for applications in gaming, simulation, and immersive social environments.

**Comment:** WorldGen introduces a system for generating traversable and interactive 3D worlds from text prompts, combining LLM-driven scene layout, procedural generation, and diffusion-based 3D generation. This matches criterion 3 (embodied AI, new benchmarks/methods for simulators) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications), as it advances generative world-building for simulation and gaming.

## 6. [Video-R4: Reinforcing Text-Rich Video Reasoning with Visual Rumination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17490) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17490
**Authors:** Yolo Yunlong Tang, Daiki Shimada, Hang Hua, Chao Huang, Jing Bi, Rogerio Feris, Chenliang Xu

**Abstract:**  Understanding text-rich videos requires reading small, transient textual cues that often demand repeated inspection. Yet most video QA models rely on single-pass perception over fixed frames, leading to hallucinations and failures on fine-grained evidence. Inspired by how humans pause, zoom, and re-read critical regions, we introduce Video-R4 (Reinforcing Text-Rich Video Reasoning with Visual Rumination), a video reasoning LMM that performs visual rumination: iteratively selecting frames, zooming into informative regions, re-encoding retrieved pixels, and updating its reasoning state. We construct two datasets with executable rumination trajectories: Video-R4-CoT-17k for supervised practice and Video-R4-RL-30k for reinforcement learning. We propose a multi-stage rumination learning framework that progressively finetunes a 7B LMM to learn atomic and mixing visual operations via SFT and GRPO-based RL. Video-R4-7B achieves state-of-the-art results on M4-ViteVQA and further generalizes to multi-page document QA, slides QA, and generic video QA, demonstrating that iterative rumination is an effective paradigm for pixel-grounded multimodal reasoning.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2: Introduces a new video reasoning LMM (large multimodal model) with a novel 'visual rumination' mechanism for text-rich video QA. Also relevant to criterion 4 as it applies vision foundation models to video reasoning.

## 7. [ChainV: Atomic Visual Hints Make Multimodal Reasoning Shorter and Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17106) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17106
**Authors:** Yuan Zhang, Ming Lu, Junwen Pan, Tao Huang, Kuan Cheng, Qi She, Shanghang Zhang

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in multimodal reasoning models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across text and vision. However, even leading models exhibit redundant self-reflection when generating lengthy reasoning chains. While training-free CoT compression methods have emerged in the LLMs domain, they rely on static visual references and thus provide limited gains for multimodal reasoning. Therefore, we propose ChainV, a framework that dynamically integrates visual hints into the reasoning process, thereby making multimodal reasoning shorter and better. Specifically, ChainV first performs a coarse visual patch selection based on the previous reasoning step, then refines it by identifying the most representative atomic visual hint according to the averaged attention intensity. Additionally, ChainV introduces a consistency-based evaluation mechanism to assess the reliability of the chosen hint, guiding the model to adaptively adjust its level of self-reflection. Eventually, the pixel coordinates of the selected visual hint and its reliability are incorporated into thinking with a Bernoulli stochastic process. Experiments indicate that our method significantly improves reasoning accuracy and efficiency, especially on math-intensive benchmarks where visual hints are crucial for multi-step symbolic reasoning. For example, ChainV achieves $2.3\%$ improvement on the MathVista within MIMO-VL-RL, while reducing inference latency by $51.4\%$ and shortening output token length by $24.5\%$.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new MLLMs): Proposes ChainV, a new framework for multimodal reasoning that dynamically integrates visual hints, improving reasoning efficiency and accuracy in VLLMs/MLLMs. Also includes clever statistical tricks (consistency-based evaluation, Bernoulli process).

## 8. [EvDiff: High Quality Video with an Event Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17492) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17492
**Authors:** Weilun Li, Lei Sun, Ruixi Gao, Qi Jiang, Yuqin Ma, Kaiwei Wang, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Luc Van Gool, Danda Pani Paudel

**Abstract:**  As neuromorphic sensors, event cameras asynchronously record changes in brightness as streams of sparse events with the advantages of high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Reconstructing intensity images from events is a highly ill-posed task due to the inherent ambiguity of absolute brightness. Early methods generally follow an end-to-end regression paradigm, directly mapping events to intensity frames in a deterministic manner. While effective to some extent, these approaches often yield perceptually inferior results and struggle to scale up in model capacity and training data. In this work, we propose EvDiff, an event-based diffusion model that follows a surrogate training framework to produce high-quality videos. To reduce the heavy computational cost of high-frame-rate video generation, we design an event-based diffusion model that performs only a single forward diffusion step, equipped with a temporally consistent EvEncoder. Furthermore, our novel Surrogate Training Framework eliminates the dependence on paired event-image datasets, allowing the model to leverage large-scale image datasets for higher capacity. The proposed EvDiff is capable of generating high-quality colorful videos solely from monochromatic event streams. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method strikes a sweet spot between fidelity and realism, outperforming existing approaches on both pixel-level and perceptual metrics.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4: Proposes EvDiff, an event-based diffusion model for high-quality video generation from event cameras, leveraging vision foundation models and surrogate training. Relevant for generative modeling in multi-modal learning.
**Relevance:** 8

## 9. [Planning with Sketch-Guided Verification for Physics-Aware Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17450) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17450
**Authors:** Yidong Huang, Zun Wang, Han Lin, Dong-Ki Kim, Shayegan Omidshafiei, Jaehong Yoon, Yue Zhang, Mohit Bansal

**Abstract:**  Recent video generation approaches increasingly rely on planning intermediate control signals such as object trajectories to improve temporal coherence and motion fidelity. However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient. Our ablation study further shows that scaling up the number of trajectory candidates consistently enhances overall performance.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4: Proposes a new planning and verification framework for physics-aware video generation using vision-language models for semantic and physical plausibility verification. Novel approach to video generation with vision foundation models.
**Relevance:** 8

## 10. [FisheyeGaussianLift: BEV Feature Lifting for Surround-View Fisheye Camera Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17210) <a id="link10"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17210
**Authors:** Shubham Sonarghare, Prasad Deshpande, Ciaran Hogan, Deepika-Rani Kaliappan-Mahalingam, Ganesh Sistu

**Abstract:**  Accurate BEV semantic segmentation from fisheye imagery remains challenging due to extreme non-linear distortion, occlusion, and depth ambiguity inherent to wide-angle projections. We present a distortion-aware BEV segmentation framework that directly processes multi-camera high-resolution fisheye images,utilizing calibrated geometric unprojection and per-pixel depth distribution estimation. Each image pixel is lifted into 3D space via Gaussian parameterization, predicting spatial means and anisotropic covariances to explicitly model geometric uncertainty. The projected 3D Gaussians are fused into a BEV representation via differentiable splatting, producing continuous, uncertainty-aware semantic maps without requiring undistortion or perspective rectification. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong segmentation performance on complex parking and urban driving scenarios, achieving IoU scores of 87.75% for drivable regions and 57.26% for vehicles under severe fisheye distortion and diverse environmental conditions.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (spatial understanding on embodied agents): Proposes a new BEV segmentation framework for fisheye camera perception, with explicit modeling of geometric uncertainty and spatial feature lifting. Also relevant to vision foundation models (criterion 4) via BEV representation learning.
**Relevance:** 8

## 11. [Vision Language Models are Confused Tourists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17004) <a id="link11"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17004
**Authors:** Patrick Amadeus Irawan, Ikhlasul Akmal Hanif, Muhammad Dehan Al Kautsar, Genta Indra Winata, Fajri Koto, Alham Fikri Aji

**Abstract:**  Although the cultural dimension has been one of the key aspects in evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their ability to remain stable across diverse cultural inputs remains largely untested, despite being crucial to support diversity and multicultural societies. Existing evaluations often rely on benchmarks featuring only a singular cultural concept per image, overlooking scenarios where multiple, potentially unrelated cultural cues coexist. To address this gap, we introduce ConfusedTourist, a novel cultural adversarial robustness suite designed to assess VLMs' stability against perturbed geographical cues. Our experiments reveal a critical vulnerability, where accuracy drops heavily under simple image-stacking perturbations and even worsens with its image-generation-based variant. Interpretability analyses further show that these failures stem from systematic attention shifts toward distracting cues, diverting the model from its intended focus. These findings highlight a critical challenge: visual cultural concept mixing can substantially impair even state-of-the-art VLMs, underscoring the urgent need for more culturally robust multimodal understanding.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (VLLMs/MLLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Introduces a new benchmark for evaluating VLMs' robustness to cultural mixing, with surprising empirical findings about model failures.
**Relevance:** 8
**Novelty:** 7

**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17053
**Authors:** Teng Fu, Mengyang Zhao, Ke Niu, Kaixin Peng, Bin Li

**Abstract:**  LVLMs have been shown to perform excellently in image-level tasks such as VQA and caption. However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions. We conduct experiments on tracking benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the previous methods.

**Comment:** OmniPT proposes a unified framework for pedestrian tracking and understanding using large vision-language models (LVLMs), with a focus on instance-level tasks and semantic understanding. This matches criterion 2 (new VLLMs/MLLMs) and is also relevant to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications).

## 13. [PEGS: Physics-Event Enhanced Large Spatiotemporal Motion Reconstruction via 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17116) <a id="link13"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17116
**Authors:** Yijun Xu, Jingrui Zhang, Hongyi Liu, Yuhan Chen, Yuanyang Wang, Qingyao Guo, Dingwen Wang, Lei Yu, Chu He

**Abstract:**  Reconstruction of rigid motion over large spatiotemporal scales remains a challenging task due to limitations in modeling paradigms, severe motion blur, and insufficient physical consistency. In this work, we propose PEGS, a framework that integrates Physical priors with Event stream enhancement within a 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline to perform deblurred target-focused modeling and motion recovery. We introduce a cohesive triple-level supervision scheme that enforces physical plausibility via an acceleration constraint, leverages event streams for high-temporal resolution guidance, and employs a Kalman regularizer to fuse multi-source observations. Furthermore, we design a motion-aware simulated annealing strategy that adaptively schedules the training process based on real-time kinematic states. We also contribute the first RGB-Event paired dataset targeting natural, fast rigid motion across diverse scenarios. Experiments show PEGS's superior performance in reconstructing motion over large spatiotemporal scales compared to mainstream dynamic methods.

**Comment:** PEGS presents a framework for large spatiotemporal motion reconstruction using 3D Gaussian Splatting, integrating physical priors and event streams. This is relevant to criterion 1 (methodological improvements to spatial understanding on embodied agents) and criterion 3 (novel methods for embodied AI), as it addresses motion recovery with physical plausibility and new data.

## 14. [Q-REAL: Towards Realism and Plausibility Evaluation for AI-Generated Content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16908) <a id="link14"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.16908
**Authors:** Shushi Wang, Zicheng Zhang, Chunyi Li, Wei Wang, Liya Ma, Fengjiao Chen, Xiaoyu Li, Xuezhi Cao, Guangtao Zhai, Xiaohong Liu

**Abstract:**  Quality assessment of AI-generated content is crucial for evaluating model capability and guiding model optimization. However, most existing quality assessment datasets and models provide only a single quality score, which is too coarse to offer targeted guidance for improving generative models. In current applications of AI-generated images, realism and plausibility are two critical dimensions, and with the emergence of unified generation-understanding models, fine-grained evaluation along these dimensions becomes especially effective for improving generative performance. Therefore, we introduce Q-Real, a novel dataset for fine-grained evaluation of realism and plausibility in AI-generated images. Q-Real consists of 3,088 images generated by popular text-to-image models. For each image, we annotate the locations of major entities and provide a set of judgment questions and attribution descriptions for these along the dimensions of realism and plausibility. Considering that recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) enable fine-grained evaluation of AI-generated images, we construct Q-Real Bench to evaluate them on two tasks: judgment and grounding with reasoning. Finally, to enhance MLLM capabilities, we design a fine-tuning framework and conduct experiments on multiple MLLMs using our dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the high quality and significance of our dataset and the comprehensiveness of the benchmark. Dataset and code will be released upon publication.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4: Introduces Q-Real, a new dataset and benchmark for fine-grained evaluation of realism and plausibility in AI-generated images, and evaluates MLLMs on these tasks. Focuses on vision foundation models and their evaluation.

## 15. [A Little More Like This: Text-to-Image Retrieval with Vision-Language Models Using Relevance Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17255) <a id="link15"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17255
**Authors:** Bulat Khaertdinov, Mirela Popa, Nava Tintarev

**Abstract:**  Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable intuitive visual search using natural language queries. However, improving their performance often requires fine-tuning and scaling to larger model variants. In this work, we propose a mechanism inspired by traditional text-based search to improve retrieval performance at inference time: relevance feedback. While relevance feedback can serve as an alternative to fine-tuning, its model-agnostic design also enables use with fine-tuned VLMs. Specifically, we introduce and evaluate four feedback strategies for VLM-based retrieval. First, we revise classical pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), which refines query embeddings based on top-ranked results. To address its limitations, we propose generative relevance feedback (GRF), which uses synthetic captions for query refinement. Furthermore, we introduce an attentive feedback summarizer (AFS), a custom transformer-based model that integrates multimodal fine-grained features from relevant items. Finally, we simulate explicit feedback using ground-truth captions as an upper-bound baseline. Experiments on Flickr30k and COCO with the VLM backbones show that GRF, AFS, and explicit feedback improve retrieval performance by 3-5% in MRR@5 for smaller VLMs, and 1-3% for larger ones, compared to retrieval with no feedback. Moreover, AFS, similarly to explicit feedback, mitigates query drift and is more robust than GRF in iterative, multi-turn retrieval settings. Our findings demonstrate that relevance feedback can consistently enhance retrieval across VLMs and open up opportunities for interactive and adaptive visual search.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2: Proposes new relevance feedback mechanisms for vision-language models (VLMs) in text-to-image retrieval, including generative and attentive feedback strategies. Also provides empirical insights into retrieval improvements.

## 16. [Align & Invert: Solving Inverse Problems with Diffusion and Flow-based Models via Representational Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16870) <a id="link16"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.16870
**Authors:** Loukas Sfountouris, Giannis Daras, Paris Giampouras

**Abstract:**  Enforcing alignment between the internal representations of diffusion or flow-based generative models and those of pretrained self-supervised encoders has recently been shown to provide a powerful inductive bias, improving both convergence and sample quality. In this work, we extend this idea to inverse problems, where pretrained generative models are employed as priors. We propose applying representation alignment (REPA) between diffusion or flow-based models and a pretrained self-supervised visual encoder, such as DINOv2, to guide the reconstruction process at inference time. Although ground-truth signals are unavailable in inverse problems, we show that aligning model representations with approximate target features can substantially enhance reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. We provide theoretical results showing (a) the relation between the REPA regularization and a divergence measure in the DINOv2 embedding space, and (b) how REPA updates steer the model's internal representations toward those of the clean image. These results offer insights into the role of REPA in improving perceptual fidelity. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art inverse problem solvers. Extensive experiments on super-resolution, box inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring confirm that our method consistently improves reconstruction quality across tasks, while also providing substantial efficiency gains by reducing the number of required discretization steps without compromising the performance of the underlying solver.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Proposes a new method for solving inverse problems using representational alignment between diffusion/flow models and self-supervised encoders, with theoretical and empirical insights.

## 17. [MorphSeek: Fine-grained Latent Representation-Level Policy Optimization for Deformable Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17392) <a id="link17"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17392
**Authors:** Runxun Zhang, Yizhou Liu, Li Dongrui, Bo XU, Jingwei Wei

**Abstract:**  Deformable image registration (DIR) remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in medical image analysis, largely due to the prohibitively high-dimensional deformation space of dense displacement fields and the scarcity of voxel-level supervision. Existing reinforcement learning frameworks often project this space into coarse, low-dimensional representations, limiting their ability to capture spatially variant deformations. We propose MorphSeek, a fine-grained representation-level policy optimization paradigm that reformulates DIR as a spatially continuous optimization process in the latent feature space. MorphSeek introduces a stochastic Gaussian policy head atop the encoder to model a distribution over latent features, facilitating efficient exploration and coarse-to-fine refinement. The framework integrates unsupervised warm-up with weakly supervised fine-tuning through Group Relative Policy Optimization, where multi-trajectory sampling stabilizes training and improves label efficiency. Across three 3D registration benchmarks (OASIS brain MRI, LiTS liver CT, and Abdomen MR-CT), MorphSeek achieves consistent Dice improvements over competitive baselines while maintaining high label efficiency with minimal parameter cost and low step-level latency overhead. Beyond optimizer specifics, MorphSeek advances a representation-level policy learning paradigm that achieves spatially coherent and data-efficient deformation optimization, offering a principled, backbone-agnostic, and optimizer-agnostic solution for scalable visual alignment in high-dimensional settings.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (methodological improvements to spatial understanding on embodied agents) and is relevant to spatial intelligence. Proposes a new fine-grained policy optimization paradigm for deformable image registration, focusing on spatially coherent optimization.

## 18. [PostCam: Camera-Controllable Novel-View Video Generation with Query-Shared Cross-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17185) <a id="link18"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17185
**Authors:** Yipeng Chen, Zhichao Ye, Zhenzhou Fang, Xinyu Chen, Xiaoyu Zhang, Jialing Liu, Nan Wang, Haomin Liu, Guofeng Zhang

**Abstract:**  We propose PostCam, a framework for novel-view video generation that enables post-capture editing of camera trajectories in dynamic scenes. We find that existing video recapture methods suffer from suboptimal camera motion injection strategies; such suboptimal designs not only limit camera control precision but also result in generated videos that fail to preserve fine visual details from the source video. To achieve more accurate and flexible motion manipulation, PostCam introduces a query-shared cross-attention module. It integrates two distinct forms of control signals: the 6-DoF camera poses and the 2D rendered video frames. By fusing them into a unified representation within a shared feature space, our model can extract underlying motion cues, which enhances both control precision and generation quality. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: the model first learns coarse camera control from pose inputs, and then incorporates visual information to refine motion accuracy and enhance visual fidelity. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that PostCam outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 20% in camera control precision and view consistency, while achieving the highest video generation quality. Our project webpage is publicly available at: https://cccqaq.github.io/PostCam.github.io/

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) and is also relevant to generative modeling in multi-modal learning. Proposes a new method for camera-controllable novel-view video generation with a clever cross-attention mechanism for spatial control.

## 19. [REMSA: An LLM Agent for Foundation Model Selection in Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17442) <a id="link19"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17442
**Authors:** Binger Chen, Tacettin Emre B\"ok, Behnood Rasti, Volker Markl, Beg\"um Demir

**Abstract:**  Foundation Models (FMs) are increasingly used in remote sensing (RS) for tasks such as environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and land-use mapping. These models include unimodal vision encoders trained on a single data modality and multimodal architectures trained on combinations of SAR, multispectral, hyperspectral, and image-text data. They support diverse RS tasks including semantic segmentation, image classification, change detection, and visual question answering. However, selecting an appropriate remote sensing foundation model (RSFM) remains difficult due to scattered documentation, heterogeneous formats, and varied deployment constraints. We introduce the RSFM Database (RS-FMD), a structured resource covering over 150 RSFMs spanning multiple data modalities, resolutions, and learning paradigms. Built on RS-FMD, we present REMSA, the first LLM-based agent for automated RSFM selection from natural language queries. REMSA interprets user requirements, resolves missing constraints, ranks candidate models using in-context learning, and provides transparent justifications. We also propose a benchmark of 75 expert-verified RS query scenarios, producing 900 configurations under an expert-centered evaluation protocol. REMSA outperforms several baselines, including naive agents, dense retrieval, and unstructured RAG-based LLMs. It operates entirely on publicly available metadata and does not access private or sensitive data.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new VLLMs/MLLMs): Introduces REMSA, an LLM-based agent for selecting remote sensing foundation models, and builds a new benchmark for RSFM selection. Also partially matches criterion 4 (foundation models in vision applications).

## 20. [Mesh RAG: Retrieval Augmentation for Autoregressive Mesh Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16807) <a id="link20"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.16807
**Authors:** Xiatao Sun, Chen Liang, Qian Wang, Daniel Rakita

**Abstract:**  3D meshes are a critical building block for applications ranging from industrial design and gaming to simulation and robotics. Traditionally, meshes are crafted manually by artists, a process that is time-intensive and difficult to scale. To automate and accelerate this asset creation, autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for artistic mesh generation. However, current methods to enhance quality typically rely on larger models or longer sequences that result in longer generation time, and their inherent sequential nature imposes a severe quality-speed trade-off. This sequential dependency also significantly complicates incremental editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mesh RAG, a novel, training-free, plug-and-play framework for autoregressive mesh generation models. Inspired by RAG for language models, our approach augments the generation process by leveraging point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and point cloud registration to retrieve, generate, and integrate mesh components. This retrieval-based approach decouples generation from its strict sequential dependency, facilitating efficient and parallelizable inference. We demonstrate the wide applicability of Mesh RAG across various foundational autoregressive mesh generation models, showing it significantly enhances mesh quality, accelerates generation speed compared to sequential part prediction, and enables incremental editing, all without model retraining.

**Comment:** Mesh RAG proposes a retrieval-augmented, training-free framework for autoregressive mesh generation, enabling efficient and parallelizable inference. This is relevant to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications), as it advances generative modeling for 3D meshes.

## 21. [Stable diffusion models reveal a persisting human and AI gap in visual creativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16814) <a id="link21"></a>

**Authors:** Silvia Rondini, Claudia Alvarez-Martin, Paula Angermair-Barkai, Olivier Penacchio, M. Paz, Matthew Pelowski, Dan Dediu, Antoni Rodriguez-Fornells, Xim Cerda-Company

**Abstract:**  While recent research suggests Large Language Models match human creative performance in divergent thinking tasks, visual creativity remains underexplored. This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models.

**Comment:** This paper empirically compares human and AI visual creativity using stable diffusion models. It provides surprising empirical results about the gap between human and AI creativity in vision, which aligns with your friend's interest in empirical insights in vision-language models (criterion 4).

## 22. [Rethinking Diffusion Model-Based Video Super-Resolution: Leveraging Dense Guidance from Aligned Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16928) <a id="link22"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.16928
**Authors:** Jingyi Xu, Meisong Zheng, Ying Chen, Minglang Qiao, Xin Deng, Mai Xu

**Abstract:**  Diffusion model (DM) based Video Super-Resolution (VSR) approaches achieve impressive perceptual quality. However, they suffer from error accumulation, spatial artifacts, and a trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity, primarily caused by inaccurate alignment and insufficient compensation between video frames. In this paper, within the DM-based VSR pipeline, we revisit the role of alignment and compensation between adjacent video frames and reveal two crucial observations: (a) the feature domain is better suited than the pixel domain for information compensation due to its stronger spatial and temporal correlations, and (b) warping at an upscaled resolution better preserves high-frequency information, but this benefit is not necessarily monotonic. Therefore, we propose a novel Densely Guided diffusion model with Aligned Features for Video Super-Resolution (DGAF-VSR), with an Optical Guided Warping Module (OGWM) to maintain high-frequency details in the aligned features and a Feature-wise Temporal Condition Module (FTCM) to deliver dense guidance in the feature domain. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DGAF-VSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in key aspects of VSR, including perceptual quality (35.82\% DISTS reduction), fidelity (0.20 dB PSNR gain), and temporal consistency (30.37\% tLPIPS reduction).

## 23. [DiffRefiner: Coarse to Fine Trajectory Planning via Diffusion Refinement with Semantic Interaction for End to End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17150) <a id="link23"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17150
**Authors:** Liuhan Yin, Runkun Ju, Guodong Guo, Erkang Cheng

**Abstract:**  Unlike discriminative approaches in autonomous driving that predict a fixed set of candidate trajectories of the ego vehicle, generative methods, such as diffusion models, learn the underlying distribution of future motion, enabling more flexible trajectory prediction. However, since these methods typically rely on denoising human-crafted trajectory anchors or random noise, there remains significant room for improvement. In this paper, we propose DiffRefiner, a novel two-stage trajectory prediction framework. The first stage uses a transformer-based Proposal Decoder to generate coarse trajectory predictions by regressing from sensor inputs using predefined trajectory anchors. The second stage applies a Diffusion Refiner that iteratively denoises and refines these initial predictions. In this way, we enhance the performance of diffusion-based planning by incorporating a discriminative trajectory proposal module, which provides strong guidance for the generative refinement process. Furthermore, we design a fine-grained denoising decoder to enhance scene compliance, enabling more accurate trajectory prediction through enhanced alignment with the surrounding environment. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffRefiner achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 87.4 EPDMS on NAVSIM v2, and 87.1 DS along with 71.4 SR on Bench2Drive, thereby setting new records on both public benchmarks. The effectiveness of each component is validated via ablation studies as well.

**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17354
**Authors:** Xiangteng He, Shunsuke Sakai, Kun Yuan, Nicolas Padoy, Tatsuhito Hasegawa, Leonid Sigal

**Abstract:**  Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (I-JEPA) learns visual representations by predicting latent embeddings of masked regions from visible context. However, it treats all regions uniformly and independently, lacking an explicit notion of where or in what order predictions should be made. Inspired by human visual perception, which deploys attention selectively and sequentially from the most informative to secondary regions, we propose DSeq-JEPA, a Discriminative Sequential Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture that bridges predictive and autoregressive self-supervised learning, integrating JEPA-style latent prediction with GPT-style sequential reasoning. Specifically, DSeq-JEPA (i) first identifies primary discriminative regions based on a transformer-derived saliency map, emphasizing the distribution of visual importance, and then (ii) predicts subsequent regions in this discriminative order, progressively forming a curriculum-like semantic progression from primary to secondary cues -- a form of GPT-style pre-training. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including image classification (ImageNet), fine-grained visual categorization (iNaturalist21, CUB-200-2011, Stanford-Cars), detection and segmentation (MS-COCO, ADE20K), and low-level reasoning tasks (Clevr/Count, Clevr/Dist), demonstrate that DSeq-JEPA consistently focuses on more discriminative and generalizable representations than I-JEPA variants.

## 25. [One-Step Diffusion Transformer for Controllable Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17138) <a id="link25"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17138
**Authors:** Yushun Fang, Yuxiang Chen, Shibo Yin, Qiang Hu, Jiangchao Yao, Ya Zhang, Xiaoyun Zhang, Yanfeng Wang

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have demonstrated remarkable perceptual quality, yet the balance between fidelity and controllability remains a problem: multi-step diffusion-based methods suffer from generative diversity and randomness, resulting in low fidelity, while one-step methods lose control flexibility due to fidelity-specific finetuning. In this paper, we present ODTSR, a one-step diffusion transformer based on Qwen-Image that performs Real-ISR considering fidelity and controllability simultaneously: a newly introduced visual stream receives low-quality images (LQ) with adjustable noise (Control Noise), and the original visual stream receives LQs with consistent noise (Prior Noise), forming the Noise-hybrid Visual Stream (NVS) design. ODTSR further employs Fidelity-aware Adversarial Training (FAA) to enhance controllability and achieve one-step inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ODTSR not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on generic Real-ISR, but also enables prompt controllability on challenging scenarios such as real-world scene text image super-resolution (STISR) of Chinese characters without training on specific datasets.

**Comment:** This paper presents a new one-step diffusion transformer for controllable real-world image super-resolution, introducing a Noise-hybrid Visual Stream and Fidelity-aware Adversarial Training.

**Abstract:**  Personalized dual-person portrait customization has considerable potential applications, such as preserving emotional memories and facilitating wedding photography planning. However, the absence of a benchmark dataset hinders the pursuit of high-quality customization in dual-person portrait generation. In this paper, we propose the PairHuman dataset, which is the first large-scale benchmark dataset specifically designed for generating dual-person portraits that meet high photographic standards. The PairHuman dataset contains more than 100K images that capture a variety of scenes, attire, and dual-person interactions, along with rich metadata, including detailed image descriptions, person localization, human keypoints, and attribute tags. We also introduce DHumanDiff, which is a baseline specifically crafted for dual-person portrait generation that features enhanced facial consistency and simultaneously balances in personalized person generation and semantic-driven scene creation. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that our dataset and method produce highly customized portraits with superior visual quality that are tailored to human preferences. Our dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/annaoooo/PairHuman.

## 27. [Dual-domain Adaptation Networks for Realistic Image Super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17217) <a id="link27"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17217
**Authors:** Chaowei Fang, Bolin Fu, De Cheng, Lechao Cheng, Guanbin Li

**Abstract:**  Realistic image super-resolution (SR) focuses on transforming real-world low-resolution (LR) images into high-resolution (HR) ones, handling more complex degradation patterns than synthetic SR tasks. This is critical for applications like surveillance, medical imaging, and consumer electronics. However, current methods struggle with limited real-world LR-HR data, impacting the learning of basic image features. Pre-trained SR models from large-scale synthetic datasets offer valuable prior knowledge, which can improve generalization, speed up training, and reduce the need for extensive real-world data in realistic SR tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Dual-domain Adaptation Networks, which is able to efficiently adapt pre-trained image SR models from simulated to real-world datasets. To achieve this target, we first set up a spatial-domain adaptation strategy through selectively updating parameters of pre-trained models and employing the low-rank adaptation technique to adjust frozen parameters. Recognizing that image super-resolution involves recovering high-frequency components, we further integrate a frequency domain adaptation branch into the adapted model, which combines the spectral data of the input and the spatial-domain backbone's intermediate features to infer HR frequency maps, enhancing the SR result. Experimental evaluations on public realistic image SR benchmarks, including RealSR, D2CRealSR, and DRealSR, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art models. Codes are available at: https://github.com/dummerchen/DAN.

**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17340
**Authors:** Yue Yin, Enze Tao, Dylan Campbell

**Abstract:**  Generative image models can produce convincingly real images, with plausible shapes, textures, layouts and lighting. However, one domain in which they perform notably poorly is in the synthesis of transparent objects, which exhibit refraction, reflection, absorption and scattering. Refraction is a particular challenge, because refracted pixel rays often intersect with surfaces observed in other parts of the image, providing a constraint on the color. It is clear from inspection that generative models have not distilled the laws of optics sufficiently well to accurately render refractive objects. In this work, we consider the problem of generating images with accurate refraction, given a text prompt. We synchronize the pixels within the object's boundary with those outside by warping and merging the pixels using Snell's Law of Refraction, at each step of the generation trajectory. For those surfaces that are not directly observed in the image, but are visible via refraction or reflection, we recover their appearance by synchronizing the image with a second generated image -- a panorama centered at the object -- using the same warping and merging procedure. We demonstrate that our approach generates much more optically-plausible images that respect the physical constraints.

**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17322
**Authors:** Dongbo Shi, Shen Cao, Bojian Wu, Jinhui Guo, Lubin Fan, Renjie Chen, Ligang Liu, Jieping Ye

**Abstract:**  In this paper, we introduce NoPe-NeRF++, a novel local-to-global optimization algorithm for training Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) without requiring pose priors. Existing methods, particularly NoPe-NeRF, which focus solely on the local relationships within images, often struggle to recover accurate camera poses in complex scenarios. To overcome the challenges, our approach begins with a relative pose initialization with explicit feature matching, followed by a local joint optimization to enhance the pose estimation for training a more robust NeRF representation. This method significantly improves the quality of initial poses. Additionally, we introduce global optimization phase that incorporates geometric consistency constraints through bundle adjustment, which integrates feature trajectories to further refine poses and collectively boost the quality of NeRF. Notably, our method is the first work that seamlessly combines the local and global cues with NeRF, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pose estimation accuracy and novel view synthesis. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate our superior performance and robustness, even in challenging scenes, thus validating our design choices.

**Comment:** Does not match any specific criteria. Focuses on NeRF optimization without pose priors, which is related to 3D vision but not directly to spatial intelligence in embodied agents, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI benchmarks, or vision foundation models.

**Abstract:**  Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown promise in aligning image and video generative models with human preferences. However, applying it to modern flow matching models is challenging because of its deterministic sampling paradigm. Current methods address this issue by converting Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), which introduce stochasticity. However, this SDE-based GRPO suffers from issues of inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for fewer-step sampling. In this paper, we first reinterpret existing SDE-based GRPO methods from a distance optimization perspective, revealing their underlying mechanism as a form of contrastive learning. Based on this insight, we propose Neighbor GRPO, a novel alignment algorithm that completely bypasses the need for SDEs. Neighbor GRPO generates a diverse set of candidate trajectories by perturbing the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy. We establish a theoretical connection between this distance-based objective and policy gradient optimization, rigorously integrating our approach into the GRPO framework. Our method fully preserves the advantages of deterministic ODE sampling, including efficiency and compatibility with high-order solvers. We further introduce symmetric anchor sampling for computational efficiency and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting to address reward flattening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neighbor GRPO significantly outperforms SDE-based counterparts in terms of training cost, convergence speed, and generation quality.

## 31. [Point-Supervised Facial Expression Spotting with Gaussian-Based Instance-Adaptive Intensity Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16952) <a id="link31"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.16952
**Authors:** Yicheng Deng, Hideaki Hayashi, Hajime Nagahara

**Abstract:**  Automatic facial expression spotting, which aims to identify facial expression instances in untrimmed videos, is crucial for facial expression analysis. Existing methods primarily focus on fully-supervised learning and rely on costly, time-consuming temporal boundary annotations. In this paper, we investigate point-supervised facial expression spotting (P-FES), where only a single timestamp annotation per instance is required for training. We propose a unique two-branch framework for P-FES. First, to mitigate the limitation of hard pseudo-labeling, which often confuses neutral and expression frames with various intensities, we propose a Gaussian-based instance-adaptive intensity modeling (GIM) module to model instance-level expression intensity distribution for soft pseudo-labeling. By detecting the pseudo-apex frame around each point label, estimating the duration, and constructing an instance-level Gaussian distribution, GIM assigns soft pseudo-labels to expression frames for more reliable intensity supervision. The GIM module is incorporated into our framework to optimize the class-agnostic expression intensity branch. Second, we design a class-aware apex classification branch that distinguishes macro- and micro-expressions solely based on their pseudo-apex frames. During inference, the two branches work independently: the class-agnostic expression intensity branch generates expression proposals, while the class-aware apex-classification branch is responsible for macro- and micro-expression classification.Furthermore, we introduce an intensity-aware contrastive loss to enhance discriminative feature learning and suppress neutral noise by contrasting neutral frames with expression frames with various intensities. Extensive experiments on the SAMM-LV, CAS(ME)$^2$, and CAS(ME)$^3$ datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

**Comment:** Some relevance to vision foundation models (criterion 4) as it proposes a new method for facial expression spotting with weak supervision, but not a direct match to the main criteria.

## 32. [Budget-Aware Tool-Use Enables Effective Agent Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17006) <a id="link32"></a>

**Abstract:**  Scaling test-time computation improves performance across different tasks on large language models (LLMs), which has also been extended to tool-augmented agents. For these agents, scaling involves not only "thinking" in tokens but also "acting" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack "budget awareness" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to "dig deeper" on a promising lead or "pivot" to new paths based on remaining resources. To analyze cost-performance scaling in a controlled manner, we formalize a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for token and tool consumption. We provide the first systematic study on budget-constrained agents, showing that budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier. Our work offers empirical insights toward a more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in tool-augmented agents.

**Comment:** Somewhat relevant to embodied AI (criterion 3), as it discusses tool-augmented agents and budget-aware planning, but not focused on spatial intelligence or simulators. Interesting empirical insights on agent scaling.

## 33. [Glass Surface Detection: Leveraging Reflection Dynamics in Flash/No-flash Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16887) <a id="link33"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.16887
**Authors:** Tao Yan, Hao Huang, Yiwei Lu, Zeyu Wang, Ke Xu, Yinghui Wang, Xiaojun Chang, Rynson W. H. Lau

**Abstract:**  Glass surfaces are ubiquitous in daily life, typically appearing colorless, transparent, and lacking distinctive features. These characteristics make glass surface detection a challenging computer vision task. Existing glass surface detection methods always rely on boundary cues (e.g., window and door frames) or reflection cues to locate glass surfaces, but they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic properties of the glass itself for accurate localization. We observed that in most real-world scenes, the illumination intensity in front of the glass surface differs from that behind it, which results in variations in the reflections visible on the glass surface. Specifically, when standing on the brighter side of the glass and applying a flash towards the darker side, existing reflections on the glass surface tend to disappear. Conversely, while standing on the darker side and applying a flash towards the brighter side, distinct reflections will appear on the glass surface. Based on this phenomenon, we propose NFGlassNet, a novel method for glass surface detection that leverages the reflection dynamics present in flash/no-flash imagery. Specifically, we propose a Reflection Contrast Mining Module (RCMM) for extracting reflections, and a Reflection Guided Attention Module (RGAM) for fusing features from reflection and glass surface for accurate glass surface detection. For learning our network, we also construct a dataset consisting of 3.3K no-flash and flash image pairs captured from various scenes with corresponding ground truth annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our code, model, and dataset will be available upon acceptance of the manuscript.

**Comment:** Glass Surface Detection introduces a new method leveraging reflection dynamics in flash/no-flash imagery for glass surface detection. While it is a novel computer vision method, it does not directly match any of the four criteria.

## 34. [Non-Parametric Probabilistic Robustness: A Conservative Metric with Optimized Perturbation Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17380) <a id="link34"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17380
**Authors:** Zheng Wang, Yi Zhang, Siddartha Khastgir, Carsten Maple, Xingyu Zhao

**Abstract:**  Deep learning (DL) models, despite their remarkable success, remain vulnerable to small input perturbations that can cause erroneous outputs, motivating the recent proposal of probabilistic robustness (PR) as a complementary alternative to adversarial robustness (AR). However, existing PR formulations assume a fixed and known perturbation distribution, an unrealistic expectation in practice. To address this limitation, we propose non-parametric probabilistic robustness (NPPR), a more practical PR metric that does not rely on any predefined perturbation distribution. Following the non-parametric paradigm in statistical modeling, NPPR learns an optimized perturbation distribution directly from data, enabling conservative PR evaluation under distributional uncertainty. We further develop an NPPR estimator based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) heads and bicubic up-sampling, covering various input-dependent and input-independent perturbation scenarios. Theoretical analyses establish the relationships among AR, PR, and NPPR. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet across ResNet18/50, WideResNet50 and VGG16 validate NPPR as a more practical robustness metric, showing up to 40\% more conservative (lower) PR estimates compared to assuming those common perturbation distributions used in state-of-the-arts.

**Authors:** Sang Truong, Yuheng Tu, Michael Hardy, Anka Reuel, Zeyu Tang, Jirayu Burapacheep, Jonathan Perera, Chibuike Uwakwe, Ben Domingue, Nick Haber, Sanmi Koyejo

**Abstract:**  Benchmarks are pivotal in driving AI progress, and invalid benchmark questions frequently undermine their reliability. Manually identifying and correcting errors among thousands of benchmark questions is not only infeasible but also a critical bottleneck for reliable evaluation. In this work, we introduce a framework for systematic benchmark revision that leverages statistical analysis of response patterns to flag potentially invalid questions for further expert review. Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic. Across nine widely used benchmarks, our method guides expert review to identify problematic questions with up to 84\% precision. In addition, we introduce an LLM-judge first pass to review questions, further reducing human effort. Together, these components provide an efficient and scalable framework for systematic benchmark revision.

**Comment:** Relevant to benchmarks and evaluation, but does not directly match any of the four criteria (no spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models). Focuses on statistical analysis for benchmark revision.

## 36. [Parameter-Free Neural Lens Blur Rendering for High-Fidelity Composites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17014) <a id="link36"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17014
**Authors:** Lingyan Ruan, Bin Chen, Taehyun Rhee

**Abstract:**  Consistent and natural camera lens blur is important for seamlessly blending 3D virtual objects into photographed real-scenes. Since lens blur typically varies with scene depth, the placement of virtual objects and their corresponding blur levels significantly affect the visual fidelity of mixed reality compositions. Existing pipelines often rely on camera parameters (e.g., focal length, focus distance, aperture size) and scene depth to compute the circle of confusion (CoC) for realistic lens blur rendering. However, such information is often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting the accessibility and generalizability of these methods. In this work, we propose a novel compositing approach that directly estimates the CoC map from RGB images, bypassing the need for scene depth or camera metadata. The CoC values for virtual objects are inferred through a linear relationship between its signed CoC map and depth, and realistic lens blur is rendered using a neural reblurring network. Our method provides flexible and practical solution for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity compositing with realistic defocus effects, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

## 37. [MolSight: Optical Chemical Structure Recognition with SMILES Pretraining, Multi-Granularity Learning and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17300) <a id="link37"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.17300
**Authors:** Wenrui Zhang, Xinggang Wang, Bin Feng, Wenyu Liu

**Abstract:**  Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) plays a pivotal role in modern chemical informatics, enabling the automated conversion of chemical structure images from scientific literature, patents, and educational materials into machine-readable molecular representations. This capability is essential for large-scale chemical data mining, drug discovery pipelines, and Large Language Model (LLM) applications in related domains. However, existing OCSR systems face significant challenges in accurately recognizing stereochemical information due to the subtle visual cues that distinguish stereoisomers, such as wedge and dash bonds, ring conformations, and spatial arrangements. To address these challenges, we propose MolSight, a comprehensive learning framework for OCSR that employs a three-stage training paradigm. In the first stage, we conduct pre-training on large-scale but noisy datasets to endow the model with fundamental perception capabilities for chemical structure images. In the second stage, we perform multi-granularity fine-tuning using datasets with richer supervisory signals, systematically exploring how auxiliary tasks-specifically chemical bond classification and atom localization-contribute to molecular formula recognition. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning for post-training optimization and introduce a novel stereochemical structure dataset. Remarkably, we find that even with MolSight's relatively compact parameter size, the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm can further enhance the model's performance on stereomolecular. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets, our results demonstrate that MolSight achieves state-of-the-art performance in (stereo)chemical optical structure recognition.

**Comment:** MolSight is a new framework for optical chemical structure recognition using multi-granularity learning and reinforcement learning. While it is a vision-language application, it does not directly match any of the four criteria, as it is not about spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models in a general sense.
