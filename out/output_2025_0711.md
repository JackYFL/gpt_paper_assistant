## 0. [Scaling RL to Long Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07966) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07966
**Authors:** Yukang Chen, Wei Huang, Baifeng Shi, Qinghao Hu, Hanrong Ye, Ligeng Zhu, Zhijian Liu, Pavlo Molchanov, Jan Kautz, Xiaojuan Qi, Sifei Liu, Hongxu Yin, Yao Lu, Song Han

**Abstract:**  We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k tokens).

**Comment:** This paper introduces a full-stack framework for scaling RL to long videos, with a new dataset, training infrastructure, and strong results in long video reasoning for VLMs. It matches criterion 2 (VLLMs), criterion 3 (new benchmark and methods for embodied AI), and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications).

## 1. [Corvid: Improving Multimodal Large Language Models Towards Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07424) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07424
**Authors:** Jingjing Jiang, Chao Ma, Xurui Song, Hanwang Zhang, Jun Luo

**Abstract:**  Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and understanding. However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work, we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector (GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality multimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning and under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art MLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical reasoning and science problem-solving. Project page: https://mm-vl.github.io/corvid.

**Comment:** Corvid is a new MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought reasoning, introducing a new architecture, dataset, and training strategy. This directly matches criterion 2 (new MLLMs/VLLMs) and is highly relevant for vision-language reasoning.

## 2. [StarDojo: Benchmarking Open-Ended Behaviors of Agentic Multimodal LLMs in Production-Living Simulations with Stardew Valley](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07445) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07445
**Authors:** Weihao Tan, Changjiu Jiang, Yu Duan, Mingcong Lei, Jiageng Li, Yitian Hong, Xinrun Wang, Bo An

**Abstract:**  Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified, user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living environments.

**Comment:** StarDojo introduces a new benchmark for evaluating agentic multimodal LLMs in a production-living simulation based on Stardew Valley. It is specifically designed for embodied AI, focusing on open-ended behaviors, and evaluates MLLMs in a simulator environment. This directly matches criterion 3 (embodied AI benchmarks/simulators) and criterion 2 (MLLMs).

## 3. [CLIP Won't Learn Object-Attribute Binding from Natural Data and Here is Why](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07985) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07985
**Authors:** Bijay Gurung, David T. Hoffmann, Thomas Brox

**Abstract:**  Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and, as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density, incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect binding.

**Comment:** This paper investigates the object-attribute binding problem in CLIP, a popular vision-language model, and rigorously analyzes why CLIP fails to learn binding from natural data. It provides new empirical insights into the limitations of VLLMs and the role of data properties, directly matching criterion 2 (VLLMs) and offering surprising empirical results.

## 4. [SURPRISE3D: A Dataset for Spatial Understanding and Reasoning in Complex 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07781) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07781
**Authors:** Jiaxin Huang, Ziwen Li, Hanlve Zhang, Runnan Chen, Xiao He, Yandong Guo, Wenping Wang, Tongliang Liu, Mingming Gong

**Abstract:**  The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world. Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research. Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite. S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic planning. The code and datasets can be found in https://github.com/liziwennba/SUPRISE.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (spatial understanding/reasoning in 3D scenes for embodied AI) and criterion 3 (new benchmark/dataset for spatial reasoning in 3D vision-language). Introduces a large-scale dataset (SURPRISE3D) and a new benchmark for spatial reasoning segmentation, with focus on avoiding shortcut biases.

## 5. [SpatialViz-Bench: Automatically Generated Spatial Visualization Reasoning Tasks for MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07610) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07610
**Authors:** Siting Wang, Luoyang Sun, Cheng Deng, Kun Shao, Minnan Pei, Zheng Tian, Haifeng Zhang, Jun Wang

**Abstract:**  Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition, displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (spatial understanding/visualization in MLLMs/embodied agents) and criterion 3 (new benchmark for spatial visualization reasoning in MLLMs). Introduces a new benchmark (SpatialViz-Bench) for spatial visualization, evaluates 33 MLLMs, and uncovers surprising empirical results about model behavior.

## 6. [PlanQA: A Benchmark for Spatial Reasoning in LLMs using Structured Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07644) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07644
**Authors:** Fedor Rodionov, Abdelrahman Eldesokey, Michael Birsak, John Femiani, Bernard Ghanem, Peter Wonka

**Abstract:**  We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms, and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

**Comment:** This paper introduces PlanQA, a benchmark for spatial reasoning in LLMs using structured representations. This directly matches criterion 3 (new benchmarks for embodied AI, simulator-related, with a novel angle) and criterion 1 (spatial understanding in agents).

## 7. [ViDove: A Translation Agent System with Multimodal Context and Memory-Augmented Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07306) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07306
**Authors:** Yichen Lu, Wei Dai, Jiaen Liu, Ching Wing Kwok, Zongheng Wu, Xudong Xiao, Ao Sun, Sheng Fu, Jianyuan Zhan, Yian Wang, Takatomo Saito, Sicheng Lai

**Abstract:**  LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge, enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28% improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here: https://github.com/pigeonai-org/ViDove

**Comment:** This paper introduces ViDove, a translation agent system with multimodal (visual + text) context and memory-augmented reasoning, and presents DoveBench, a new benchmark for long-form video subtitling and translation. It matches criterion 2 (new MLLMs) and criterion 3 (new benchmark for embodied/vision-language tasks), and is highly relevant for multi-modal generative modeling and vision-language models.

## 8. [MIRA: A Novel Framework for Fusing Modalities in Medical RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07902) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07902
**Authors:** Jinhong Wang, Tajamul Ashraf, Zongyan Han, Jorma Laaksonen, Rao Mohammad Anwer

**Abstract:**  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/MIRA.

**Comment:** MIRA is a new framework for fusing modalities in medical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with MLLMs, introducing modules for calibrated retrieval and multimodal reasoning. It directly matches criterion 2 (new MLLMs) and is relevant to vision foundation models and their applications (criterion 4).

## 9. [Robust Multimodal Large Language Models Against Modality Conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07151) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07151
**Authors:** Zongmeng Zhang, Wengang Zhou, Jie Zhao, Houqiang Li

**Abstract:**  Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

**Comment:** This paper investigates hallucinations in MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict, introduces a new dataset (MMMC), and proposes methods to mitigate hallucination. This matches criterion 2 (new MLLMs/insights) and is relevant for robustness in vision-language models.

## 10. [EscherNet++: Simultaneous Amodal Completion and Scalable View Synthesis through Masked Fine-Tuning and Enhanced Feed-Forward 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07410) <a id="link10"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07410
**Authors:** Xinan Zhang, Muhammad Zubair Irshad, Anthony Yezzi, Yi-Chang Tsai, Zsolt Kira

**Abstract:**  We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings, while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

**Comment:** This paper introduces EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model for simultaneous amodal completion and scalable view synthesis, with strong results in 3D reconstruction and occlusion reasoning. This is highly relevant to vision foundation models and their applications (criterion 4), and also touches on spatial understanding (criterion 1).

## 11. [PacGDC: Label-Efficient Generalizable Depth Completion with Projection Ambiguity and Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07374) <a id="link11"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07374
**Authors:** Haotian Wang, Aoran Xiao, Xiaoqin Zhang, Meng Yang, Shijian Lu

**Abstract:**  Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection, allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene. This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

**Comment:** PacGDC proposes a label-efficient, generalizable depth completion method using projection ambiguity and consistency, leveraging multiple depth foundation models for data synthesis. This is a methodological improvement in spatial understanding and uses vision foundation models (criterion 1 and 4).

## 12. [ViLU: Learning Vision-Language Uncertainties for Failure Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07620) <a id="link12"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07620
**Authors:** Marc Lafon, Yannis Karmim, Julio Silva-Rodriguez, Paul Couairon, Cl\'ement Rambour, Rapha\"el Fournier-Sniehotta, Ismail Ben Ayed, Jose Dolz, Nicolas Thome

**Abstract:**  Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations. ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found here: https://github.com/ykrmm/ViLU.

**Authors:** Pierre Marza, Leo Fillioux, Sofi\`ene Boutaj, Kunal Mahatha, Christian Desrosiers, Pablo Piantanida, Jose Dolz, Stergios Christodoulidis, Maria Vakalopoulou

**Abstract:**  Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16 different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness. The code for THUNDER is publicly available at https://github.com/MICS-Lab/thunder.

**Comment:** This paper introduces THUNDER, a benchmark for tile-level histopathology image understanding using foundation models, directly matching criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) and partially criterion 3 (benchmarking).

## 15. [Rethinking Query-based Transformer for Continual Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07831) <a id="link15"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07831
**Authors:** Yuchen Zhu, Cheng Shi, Dingyou Wang, Jiajin Tang, Zhengxuan Wei, Yu Wu, Guanbin Li, Sibei Yang

**Abstract:**  Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study, however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks, settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.

**Comment:** The paper proposes SimCIS, a new baseline for continual image segmentation using query-based transformers, with novel mechanisms for preserving objectness and combating catastrophic forgetting. It introduces new methods for continual learning in segmentation, which is relevant to embodied AI and spatial understanding (criterion 1), and also presents a new approach for a vision task that could be used in embodied agents (criterion 3).

## 16. [Single-Step Latent Diffusion for Underwater Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07878) <a id="link16"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07878
**Authors:** Jiayi Wu, Tianfu Wang, Md Abu Bakr Siddique, Md Jahidul Islam, Cornelia Fermuller, Yiannis Aloimonos, Christopher A. Metzler

**Abstract:**  Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast, and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models -- which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project website https://tianfwang.github.io/slurpp/.

**Comment:** This paper presents a new method for underwater image restoration using a novel latent diffusion architecture (SLURPP) and a physics-based synthetic data pipeline. It leverages pretrained latent diffusion models with explicit scene decomposition, which encodes strong priors on geometry and depth. This is a methodological improvement in spatial understanding for vision tasks, relevant to embodied agents in underwater environments. Closely matches criterion 1.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07415
**Authors:** Xinyao Yu, Hao Sun, Zeyu Ling, Ziwei Niu, Zhenjia Bai, Rui Qin, Yen-Wei Chen, Lanfen Lin

**Abstract:**  In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC). Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach, our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance on the MM-IMDB dataset.

**Comment:** EPIC proposes an efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy for text-image classification, reducing computational cost for LMMs. This is relevant to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications), and also touches on efficient multi-modal learning.

## 18. [Spline Deformation Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07521) <a id="link18"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07521
**Authors:** Mingyang Song, Yang Zhang, Marko Mihajlovic, Siyu Tang, Markus Gross, Tun\c{c} Ozan Ayd{\i}n

**Abstract:**  Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields, often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs. Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a spline-based trajectory representation for dense point trajectory modeling, which is a methodological improvement in spatial modeling. This is relevant to criterion 1 (new methodological improvements to spatial understanding), especially for spatial coherence and dynamic scene reconstruction.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07591
**Authors:** Kuiyuan Sun, Yuxuan Zhang, Jichao Zhang, Jiaming Liu, Wei Wang, Niculae Sebe, Yao Zhao

**Abstract:**  While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter, a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view hair transfer. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/sunkymepro/StableHairV2.

**Comment:** This paper presents a new diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer model, which is a novel generative modeling approach in computer vision. It introduces a multi-view diffusion model with pose conditioning and temporal attention for consistent hair transfer, and establishes a new benchmark in multi-view hair transfer.

**Abstract:**  Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data, synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally, camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07995
**Authors:** Shivam Duggal, Sanghyun Byun, William T. Freeman, Antonio Torralba, Phillip Isola

**Abstract:**  According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality. KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more. Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs. out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

**Authors:** Mingkai Jia, Wei Yin, Xiaotao Hu, Jiaxin Guo, Xiaoyang Guo, Qian Zhang, Xiao-Xiao Long, Ping Tan

**Abstract:**  Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction quality, however, there still exists a large gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs. To narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks featuring resolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance of existing methods rigorously. \NickName~achieves the \textbf{state-of-the-art performance on both ImageNet and $8$ zero-shot benchmarks} across all VQ-VAEs. Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly, with rFID $\textbf{0.49}$ v.s. $\textbf{0.91}$, and achieve superior PSNR on all zero-shot benchmarks. These results highlight the superiority of \NickName~in reconstruction and pave the way for preserving fidelity in HD image processing tasks.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07381
**Authors:** Hao Xu, Arbind Agrahari Baniya, Sam Wells, Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek, Richard Dazeley, Sunil Aryal

**Abstract:**  Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

**Comment:** The paper presents a new multi-scale attention and gated shifting module for fine-grained event spotting in videos, and introduces a new benchmark for table tennis event spotting. This is a new benchmark and method for video understanding, which could be relevant to embodied AI (criterion 3), especially for agents learning from video, but the focus is not on embodied agents or simulators per se.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07483
**Authors:** Qiangqiang Wu, Yi Yu, Chenqi Kong, Ziquan Liu, Jia Wan, Haoliang Li, Alex C. Kot, Antoni B. Chan

**Abstract:**  With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g., YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT). However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency, limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

**Authors:** Ruixiang Chen, Guolei Sun, Yawei Li, Jie Qin, Luca Benini

**Abstract:**  This paper presents enhancements to the SAM2 framework for video object tracking task, addressing challenges such as occlusions, background clutter, and target reappearance. We introduce a hierarchical motion estimation strategy, combining lightweight linear prediction with selective non-linear refinement to improve tracking accuracy without requiring additional training.

Experimental results show consistent improvements across different model scales. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on LaSOT and LaSOText with the large model, achieving 9.6% and 7.2% relative improvements in AUC over the original SAM2, and demonstrates even larger relative gains on smaller models, highlighting the effectiveness of our trainless, low-overhead improvements for boosting long-term tracking performance.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07585
**Authors:** Wenfeng Jia, Bin Liang, Yuxi Lu, Attavit Wilaiwongsakul, Muhammad Arif Khan, Lihong Zheng

**Abstract:**  Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the 2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting 3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps suitable for rapid disaster response.

**Authors:** Arshak Rezvani, Ali Akbari, Kosar Sanjar Arani, Maryam Mirian, Emad Arasteh, Martin J. McKeown

**Abstract:**  Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes -- generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference, caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

**Comment:** This paper presents an interpretable EEG-to-image generation framework using semantic prompts and a large language model, which is relevant to multi-modal generative modeling but does not directly match the four criteria.

## 28. [AI Should Sense Better, Not Just Scale Bigger: Adaptive Sensing as a Paradigm Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07820) <a id="link28"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07820
**Authors:** Eunsu Baek, Keondo Park, Jeonggil Ko, Min-hwan Oh, Taesik Gong, Hyung-Sin Kim

**Abstract:**  Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input (e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods. Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

**Comment:** This paper advocates for adaptive sensing as a paradigm shift in AI, focusing on sensor-level adaptation to improve efficiency and robustness. While it discusses multimodal integration and benchmarks, it is more of a position/roadmap paper and does not introduce a new method, VLLM/MLLM, or benchmark itself. It is tangentially related to embodied AI (criterion 3) and spatial intelligence (criterion 1), but not a direct match.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07257
**Authors:** Licong Xu, Milind Sarkar, Anto I. Lonappan, \'I\~nigo Zubeldia, Pablo Villanueva-Domingo, Santiago Casas, Christian Fidler, Chetana Amancharla, Ujjwal Tiwari, Adrian Bayer, Chadi Ait Ekiou, Miles Cranmer, Adrian Dimitrov, James Fergusson, Kahaan Gandhi, Sven Krippendorf, Andrew Laverick, Julien Lesgourgues, Antony Lewis, Thomas Meier, Blake Sherwin, Kristen Surrao, Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro, Chi Wang, Xueqing Xu, Boris Bolliet

**Abstract:**  We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks, cmbagent. The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents and implements a Planning & Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases, writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.

**Comment:** Presents a multi-agent system of LLMs for autonomous scientific discovery, with planning and control, but not focused on spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, or embodied AI benchmarks. Interesting for agentic workflows.

## 30. [X-RAFT: Cross-Modal Non-Rigid Registration of Blue and White Light Neurosurgical Hyperspectral Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07747) <a id="link30"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07747
**Authors:** Charlie Budd, Silv\`ere S\'egaud, Matthew Elliot, Graeme Stasiuk, Yijing Xie, Jonathan Shapey, Tom Vercauteren

**Abstract:**  Integration of hyperspectral imaging into fluorescence-guided neurosurgery has the potential to improve surgical decision making by providing quantitative fluorescence measurements in real-time. Quantitative fluorescence requires paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light) mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available after the review process.

**Comment:** This paper introduces X-RAFT, a cross-modal optical flow model for non-rigid registration of hyperspectral neurosurgical images. While it is a novel method for cross-modal registration, it does not directly address spatial intelligence for embodied agents, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI benchmarks, or vision foundation models. Relevant to computer vision, but not a direct match to any criterion.

## 31. [Compressive Imaging Reconstruction via Tensor Decomposed Multi-Resolution Grid Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07707) <a id="link31"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07707
**Authors:** Zhenyu Jin, Yisi Luo, Xile Zhao, Deyu Meng

**Abstract:**  Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI reconstruction method.

**Comment:** The paper presents a new method for compressive imaging reconstruction using tensor decomposed multi-resolution grid encoding. While it is a methodological improvement in computer vision, it does not directly address spatial intelligence in embodied agents, VLLMs/MLLMs, benchmarks for embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

## 32. [Doodle Your Keypoints: Sketch-Based Few-Shot Keypoint Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07994) <a id="link32"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07994
**Authors:** Subhajit Maity, Ayan Kumar Bhunia, Subhadeep Koley, Pinaki Nath Chowdhury, Aneeshan Sain, Yi-Zhe Song

**Abstract:**  Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However, challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

**Comment:** This paper introduces a sketch-based few-shot keypoint detection framework, which is relevant to computer vision and multi-modal learning, but does not directly match any of the four criteria.

## 33. [Motion-Aware Adaptive Pixel Pruning for Efficient Local Motion Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07708) <a id="link33"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07708
**Authors:** Wei Shang, Dongwei Ren, Wanying Zhang, Pengfei Zhu, Qinghua Hu, Wangmeng Zuo

**Abstract:**  Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$ convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT). The source code is available at https://github.com/shangwei5/M2AENet.

**Comment:** Presents a motion-aware adaptive pixel pruning method for efficient local motion deblurring. While it involves spatial modeling, it is not focused on embodied agents or spatial intelligence in the context of embodied AI.

## 34. [Position: We Need An Algorithmic Understanding of Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07544) <a id="link34"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07544
**Authors:** Oliver Eberle, Thomas McGee, Hamza Giaffar, Taylor Webb, Ida Momennejad

**Abstract:**  What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use. AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent systems.

**Comment:** A position paper proposing a framework for understanding the algorithms learned by LLMs, with a case study on emergent search algorithms. Not directly about spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, or embodied AI, but relevant for interpretability.

## 35. [Application of LLMs to Multi-Robot Path Planning and Task Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07302) <a id="link35"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07302
**Authors:** Ashish Kumar

**Abstract:**  Efficient exploration is a well known problem in deep reinforcement learning and this problem is exacerbated in multi-agent reinforcement learning due the intrinsic complexities of such algorithms. There are several approaches to efficiently explore an environment to learn to solve tasks by multi-agent operating in that environment, of which, the idea of expert exploration is investigated in this work. More specifically, this work investigates the application of large-language models as expert planners for efficient exploration in planning based tasks for multiple agents.

**Comment:** This paper explores the use of large language models as expert planners for multi-robot path planning and task allocation. While it involves LLMs and multi-agent systems, it does not focus on visual or multi-modal LLMs, nor does it introduce new benchmarks or methods for embodied AI in a simulator context. Some relevance to embodied AI, but not a direct match to the listed criteria.

## 36. [Dual Semantic-Aware Network for Noise Suppressed Ultrasound Video Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07443) <a id="link36"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07443
**Authors:** Ling Zhou, Runtian Yuan, Yi Liu, Yuejie Zhang, Rui Feng, Shang Gao

**Abstract:**  Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames, effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation, significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some image-based models. Code can be found in \href{https://github.com/ZhouL2001/DSANet}{DSANet}

**Comment:** The paper proposes a dual semantic-aware network for noise-robust ultrasound video segmentation, focusing on mutual semantic awareness between local and global features. While it is a methodological improvement in medical image segmentation, it does not directly address spatial intelligence for embodied agents, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI benchmarks, or vision foundation models. Relevant to general computer vision, but not a direct match to any criterion.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07721
**Authors:** Haoyu Pan, Hongxin Lin, Zetian Feng, Chuxuan Lin, Junyang Mo, Chu Zhang, Zijian Wu, Yi Wang, Qingqing Zheng

**Abstract:**  The development of robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound (BUS) image analysis is significantly constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated data. To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology, echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical applications.

**Comment:** Does not match any specific criterion. Focuses on medical image generation for breast ultrasound, not spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

## 38. [CL-Polyp: A Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Network for Accurate Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07154) <a id="link38"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07154
**Authors:** Desheng Li, Chaoliang Liu, Zhiyong Xiao

**Abstract:**  Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However, these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules: the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA) module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets, respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation tasks.

**Comment:** Presents a contrastive learning-enhanced network for polyp segmentation, with some spatial modeling, but not focused on embodied agents or spatial intelligence in the context of embodied AI.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07949
**Authors:** Sizhen Bian, Mengxi Liu, Vitor Fortes Rey, Daniel Geissler, Paul Lukowicz

**Abstract:**  Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on resource-constrained wearable devices demands inference models that harmonize accuracy with computational efficiency. This paper introduces TinierHAR, an ultra-lightweight deep learning architecture that synergizes residual depthwise separable convolutions, gated recurrent units (GRUs), and temporal aggregation to achieve SOTA efficiency without compromising performance. Evaluated across 14 public HAR datasets, TinierHAR reduces Parameters by 2.7x (vs. TinyHAR) and 43.3x (vs. DeepConvLSTM), and MACs by 6.4x and 58.6x, respectively, while maintaining the averaged F1-scores. Beyond quantitative gains, this work provides the first systematic ablation study dissecting the contributions of spatial-temporal components across proposed TinierHAR, prior SOTA TinyHAR, and the classical DeepConvLSTM, offering actionable insights for designing efficient HAR systems. We finally discussed the findings and suggested principled design guidelines for future efficient HAR. To catalyze edge-HAR research, we open-source all materials in this work for future benchmarking\footnote{https://github.com/zhaxidele/TinierHAR}

**Comment:** This paper focuses on efficient human activity recognition models for edge devices, with some spatial-temporal modeling, but does not introduce new methods for spatial understanding in embodied agents or benchmarks. Closest to general computer vision efficiency.

## 40. [Bluish Veil Detection and Lesion Classification using Custom Deep Learnable Layers with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07453) <a id="link40"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07453
**Authors:** M. A. Rasel, Sameem Abdul Kareem, Zhenli Kwan, Shin Shen Yong, Unaizah Obaidellah

**Abstract:**  Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of 85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and 90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI, significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.
