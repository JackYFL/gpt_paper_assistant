## 0. [Learning to Drive is a Free Gift: Large-Scale Label-Free Autonomy Pretraining from Unposed In-The-Wild Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22091) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.22091
**Authors:** Matthew Strong, Wei-Jer Chang, Quentin Herau, Jiezhi Yang, Yihan Hu, Chensheng Peng, Wei Zhan

**Abstract:**  Ego-centric driving videos available online provide an abundant source of visual data for autonomous driving, yet their lack of annotations makes it difficult to learn representations that capture both semantic structure and 3D geometry. Recent advances in large feedforward spatial models demonstrate that point maps and ego-motion can be inferred in a single forward pass, suggesting a promising direction for scalable driving perception. We therefore propose a label-free, teacher-guided framework for learning autonomous driving representations directly from unposed videos. Unlike prior self-supervised approaches that focus primarily on frame-to-frame consistency, we posit that safe and reactive driving depends critically on temporal context. To this end, we leverage a feedforward architecture equipped with a lightweight autoregressive module, trained using multi-modal supervisory signals that guide the model to jointly predict current and future point maps, camera poses, semantic segmentation, and motion masks. Multi-modal teachers provide sequence-level pseudo-supervision, enabling LFG to learn a unified pseudo-4D representation from raw YouTube videos without poses, labels, or LiDAR. The resulting encoder not only transfers effectively to downstream autonomous driving planning on the NAVSIM benchmark, surpassing multi-camera and LiDAR baselines with only a single monocular camera, but also yields strong performance when evaluated on a range of semantic, geometric, and qualitative motion prediction tasks. These geometry and motion-aware features position LFG as a compelling video-centric foundation model for autonomous driving.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (spatial understanding and intelligence in embodied agents, specifically for autonomous driving), criterion 3 (new method for label-free pretraining from in-the-wild videos, with a new approach to learning spatial and temporal representations for driving), and criterion 4 (video-centric foundation model for autonomous driving). The method is notable for learning geometry and motion-aware features from raw videos without labels or poses.

## 1. [SkyReels-V4: Multi-modal Video-Audio Generation, Inpainting and Editing model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21818) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21818
**Authors:** Guibin Chen, Dixuan Lin, Jiangping Yang, Youqiang Zhang, Zhengcong Fei, Debang Li, Sheng Chen, Chaofeng Ao, Nuo Pang, Yiming Wang, Yikun Dou, Zheng Chen, Mingyuan Fan, Tuanhui Li, Mingshan Chang, Hao Zhang, Xiaopeng Sun, Jingtao Xu, Yuqiang Xie, Jiahua Wang, Zhiheng Xu, Weiming Xiong, Yuzhe Jin, Baoxuan Gu, Binjie Mao, Yunjie Yu, Jujie He, Yuhao Feng, Shiwen Tu, Chaojie Wang, Rui Yan, Wei Shen, Jingchen Wu, Peng Zhao, Xuanyue Zhong, Zhuangzhuang Liu, Kaifei Wang, Fuxiang Zhang, Weikai Xu, Wenyan Liu, Binglu Zhang, Yu Shen, Tianhui Xiong, Bin Peng, Liang Zeng, Xuchen Song, Haoxiang Guo, Peiyu Wang, Yahui Zhou

**Abstract:**  SkyReels V4 is a unified multi modal video foundation model for joint video audio generation, inpainting, and editing. The model adopts a dual stream Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture, where one branch synthesizes video and the other generates temporally aligned audio, while sharing a powerful text encoder based on the Multimodal Large Language Models (MMLM). SkyReels V4 accepts rich multi modal instructions, including text, images, video clips, masks, and audio references. By combining the MMLMs multi modal instruction following capability with in context learning in the video branch MMDiT, the model can inject fine grained visual guidance under complex conditioning, while the audio branch MMDiT simultaneously leverages audio references to guide sound generation. On the video side, we adopt a channel concatenation formulation that unifies a wide range of inpainting style tasks, such as image to video, video extension, and video editing under a single interface, and naturally extends to vision referenced inpainting and editing via multi modal prompts. SkyReels V4 supports up to 1080p resolution, 32 FPS, and 15 second duration, enabling high fidelity, multi shot, cinema level video generation with synchronized audio. To make such high resolution, long-duration generation computationally feasible, we introduce an efficiency strategy: Joint generation of low resolution full sequences and high-resolution keyframes, followed by dedicated super-resolution and frame interpolation models. To our knowledge, SkyReels V4 is the first video foundation model that simultaneously supports multi-modal input, joint video audio generation, and a unified treatment of generation, inpainting, and editing, while maintaining strong efficiency and quality at cinematic resolutions and durations.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new MLLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Introduces SkyReels V4, a unified multi-modal video foundation model for joint video-audio generation, inpainting, and editing, with a novel dual-stream architecture and efficiency strategies.

## 2. [WeaveTime: Stream from Earlier Frames into Emergent Memory in VideoLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22142) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.22142
**Authors:** Yulin Zhang, Cheng Shi, Sibei Yang

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have greatly improved visual understanding and reasoning, yet their quadratic attention and offline training protocols make them ill-suited for streaming settings where frames arrive sequentially and future observations are inaccessible. We diagnose a core limitation of current Video-LLMs, namely Time-Agnosticism, in which videos are treated as an unordered bag of evidence rather than a causally ordered sequence, yielding two failures in streams: temporal order ambiguity, in which the model cannot follow or reason over the correct chronological order, and past-current focus blindness where it fails to distinguish present observations from accumulated history. We present WeaveTime, a simple, efficient, and model agnostic framework that first teaches order and then uses order. We introduce a lightweight Temporal Reconstruction objective-our Streaming Order Perception enhancement-that instills order aware representations with minimal finetuning and no specialized streaming data. At inference, a Past-Current Dynamic Focus Cache performs uncertainty triggered, coarse-to-fine retrieval, expanding history only when needed. Plugged into exsiting Video-LLM without architectural changes, WeaveTime delivers consistent gains on representative streaming benchmarks, improving accuracy while reducing latency. These results establish WeaveTime as a practical path toward time aware stream Video-LLMs under strict online, time causal constraints. Code and weights will be made publicly available. Project Page: https://zhangyl4.github.io/publications/weavetime/

**Comment:** Proposes WeaveTime, a framework for streaming Video-LLMs that instills temporal order awareness and dynamic memory. Directly matches criterion 2 (new VLLMs/MLLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications), with a novel angle on streaming and temporal reasoning.

## 3. [PanoEnv: Exploring 3D Spatial Intelligence in Panoramic Environments with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21992) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21992
**Authors:** Zekai Lin, Xu Zheng

**Abstract:**  360 panoramic images are increasingly used in virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics for holistic scene understanding. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with 3D spatial reasoning on Equirectangular Projection (ERP) images due to geometric distortion and limited 3D supervision. We introduce PanoEnv, a large-scale VQA benchmark built from synthetic 3D environments, containing 14.8K questions across five categories (e.g., relative position, volume comparison) grounded in accurate 3D annotations including depth, segmentation, and bounding boxes. Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals limited 3D understanding, achieving only 49.34% overall accuracy and 8.36% on open-ended (OE) questions. To enhance 3D reasoning, we propose a reinforcement learning post-training framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a ground-truth-guided reward that incorporates five geometry-aware strategies such as distance tolerance and spatial consistency. A two-stage curriculum further mitigates catastrophic forgetting: Stage 1 trains on structured tasks (true/false and multiple choice), and Stage 2 fine-tunes on mixed open-ended data to improve generalization. Our 7B model achieves new state-of-the-art performance, improving overall accuracy to 52.93% (+3.59%) and open-ended accuracy to 14.83% while maintaining structured-task performance. It also achieves top semantic evaluation scores (Q-Score 6.24, P-Score 5.95), surpassing 32B models. These results demonstrate that PanoEnv-QA and our curriculum-based RL framework effectively instill 3D spatial intelligence in VLMs for omnidirectional perception.

**Comment:** Directly matches criterion 1 (new methodological improvements to spatial understanding/spatial intelligence on embodied agents) and criterion 3 (new benchmark for 3D spatial intelligence in panoramic environments, with RL-based improvements). Also relevant to criterion 2 (VLMs) as it benchmarks and improves VLMs for 3D reasoning.

## 4. [UniVBench: Towards Unified Evaluation for Video Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21835) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21835
**Authors:** Jianhui Wei, Xiaotian Zhang, Yichen Li, Yuan Wang, Yan Zhang, Ziyi Chen, Zhihang Tang, Wei Xu, Zuozhu Liu

**Abstract:**  Video foundation models aim to integrate video understanding, generation, editing, and instruction following within a single framework, making them a central direction for next-generation multimodal systems. However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain fragmented and limited in scope, as they each target a single task, rely on task-specific metrics, and typically use short or simple video clips. As a result, they do not capture the unified capabilities that these models are designed to deliver. To address this gap, we introduce UniVBench, a benchmark purpose-built for evaluating video foundation models across four core abilities: video understanding, video generation, video editing, and a newly proposed task, video reconstruction, which assesses how faithfully a model can reproduce video content it has encountered. Our benchmark substantially expands the complexity of evaluation by incorporating 200 high-quality, diverse and multi-shot videos, each paired with detailed captions, multi-format editing instructions, and reference images. All videos are human-created and carefully validated, offering richer cinematic information than prior benchmarks. In addition, we develop a unified agentic evaluation system (UniV-Eval) that standardizes prompting, instruction parsing, and scoring across all tasks, enabling fair, scalable, and reproducible comparisons of unified video models. By grounding evaluation in instruction-based multi-shot video tasks, UniVBench provides the first framework for measuring the integrated capabilities that video foundation models aim to achieve. Extensive human annotations ensure our evaluation aligns with human judgment, enabling rigorous assessment and accelerating progress toward robust video intelligence.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (new benchmark for video foundation models, with unified evaluation across multiple video tasks) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and their evaluation). The benchmark is comprehensive and addresses a gap in unified evaluation for video foundation models.

## 5. [MMLoP: Multi-Modal Low-Rank Prompting for Efficient Vision-Language Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21397) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21397
**Authors:** Sajjad Ghiasvand, Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie, Mahnoosh Alizadeh, Ramtin Pedarsani

**Abstract:**  Prompt learning has become a dominant paradigm for adapting vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP to downstream tasks without modifying pretrained weights. While extending prompts to both vision and text encoders across multiple transformer layers significantly boosts performance, it dramatically increases the number of trainable parameters, with state-of-the-art methods requiring millions of parameters and abandoning the parameter efficiency that makes prompt tuning attractive. In this work, we propose \textbf{MMLoP} (\textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{Lo}w-Rank \textbf{P}rompting), a framework that achieves deep multi-modal prompting with only \textbf{11.5K trainable parameters}, comparable to early text-only methods like CoOp. MMLoP parameterizes vision and text prompts at each transformer layer through a low-rank factorization, which serves as an implicit regularizer against overfitting on few-shot training data. To further close the accuracy gap with state-of-the-art methods, we introduce three complementary components: a self-regulating consistency loss that anchors prompted representations to frozen zero-shot CLIP features at both the feature and logit levels, a uniform drift correction that removes the global embedding shift induced by prompt tuning to preserve class-discriminative structure, and a shared up-projection that couples vision and text prompts through a common low-rank factor to enforce cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and 11 diverse datasets demonstrate that MMLoP achieves a highly favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, outperforming the majority of existing methods including those with orders of magnitude more parameters, while achieving a harmonic mean of 79.70\% on base-to-novel generalization.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) and criterion 2 (new methods for VLM/MLLM adaptation). Introduces a highly parameter-efficient multi-modal prompting method for vision-language models, with clever statistical tricks (low-rank factorization, drift correction, consistency loss).

## 6. [RT-RMOT: A Dataset and Framework for RGB-Thermal Referring Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22033) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.22033
**Authors:** Yanqiu Yu, Zhifan Jin, Sijia Chen, Tongfei Chu, En Yu, Liman Liu, Wenbing Tao

**Abstract:**  Referring Multi-Object Tracking has attracted increasing attention due to its human-friendly interactive characteristics, yet it exhibits limitations in low-visibility conditions, such as nighttime, smoke, and other challenging scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new RGB-Thermal RMOT task, named RT-RMOT, which aims to fuse RGB appearance features with the illumination robustness of the thermal modality to enable all-day referring multi-object tracking. To promote research on RT-RMOT, we construct the first Referring Multi-Object Tracking dataset under RGB-Thermal modality, named RefRT. It contains 388 language descriptions, 1,250 tracked targets, and 166,147 Language-RGB-Thermal (L-RGB-T) triplets. Furthermore, we propose RTrack, a framework built upon a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that integrates RGB, thermal, and textual features. Since the initial framework still leaves room for improvement, we introduce a Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) strategy to further exploit the model's potential. To alleviate training instability during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a Clipped Advantage Scaling (CAS) strategy to suppress gradient explosion. In addition, we design Structured Output Reward and Comprehensive Detection Reward to balance exploration and exploitation, thereby improving the completeness and accuracy of target perception. Extensive experiments on the RefRT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RTrack framework.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 (shows a new MLLM for RGB-Thermal referring multi-object tracking) and 3 (introduces a new benchmark/dataset and framework for multi-modal tracking, with novel RL-based optimization strategies). Strong match for multi-modal large language models and new benchmarks in embodied AI.

## 7. [ProactiveMobile: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Boosting Proactive Intelligence on Mobile Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21858) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21858
**Authors:** Dezhi Kong, Zhengzhao Feng, Qiliang Liang, Hao Wang, Haofei Sun, Changpeng Yang, Yang Li, Peng Zhou, Shuai Nie, Hongzhen Wang, Linfeng Zhou, Hao Jia, Jiaming Xu, Runyu Shi, Ying Huang

**Abstract:**  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in mobile agent development, yet their capabilities are predominantly confined to a reactive paradigm, where they merely execute explicit user commands. The emerging paradigm of proactive intelligence, where agents autonomously anticipate needs and initiate actions, represents the next frontier for mobile agents. However, its development is critically bottlenecked by the lack of benchmarks that can address real-world complexity and enable objective, executable evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ProactiveMobile, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically advance research in this domain. ProactiveMobile formalizes the proactive task as inferring latent user intent across four dimensions of on-device contextual signals and generating an executable function sequence from a comprehensive function pool of 63 APIs. The benchmark features over 3,660 instances of 14 scenarios that embrace real-world complexity through multi-answer annotations. To ensure quality, a team of 30 experts conducts a final audit of the benchmark, verifying factual accuracy, logical consistency, and action feasibility, and correcting any non-compliant entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct achieves a success rate of 19.15%, outperforming o1 (15.71%) and GPT-5 (7.39%). This result indicates that proactivity is a critical competency widely lacking in current MLLMs, yet it is learnable, emphasizing the importance of the proposed benchmark for proactivity evaluation.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (new benchmark for embodied/mobile agents, focusing on proactive intelligence in MLLMs, which is a novel angle), and criterion 2 (MLLMs).
**Relevance:** 9

## 8. [Synergizing Understanding and Generation with Interleaved Analyzing-Drafting Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21435) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21435
**Authors:** Shengqiong Wu, Bobo Li, Xinkai Wang, Xiangtai Li, Lei Cui, Furu Wei, Shuicheng Yan, Hao Fei, Tat-seng Chua

**Abstract:**  Unified Vision-Language Models (UVLMs) aim to advance multimodal learning by supporting both understanding and generation within a single framework. However, existing approaches largely focus on architectural unification while overlooking the need for explicit interaction between the two capabilities during task solving. As a result, current models treat understanding and generation as parallel skills rather than synergistic processes. To achieve real synergy, we introduce the interleaved Analyzing-Drafting problem-solving loop (AD-Loop), a new think paradigm that dynamically alternates between analytic and drafting operations. By interleaving textual thoughts with visual thoughts, AD-Loop enables models to iteratively refine both comprehension and outputs, fostering genuine synergy. To train this mechanism, we design a two-stage strategy: supervised learning on interleaved thought data to initialize alternation, followed by reinforcement learning to promote adaptive and autonomous control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AD-Loop consistently improves performance across standard benchmarks for both understanding and generation, with strong transferability to various UVLMs architectures. Visual analyses further validate the effectiveness of implicit visual thoughts. These results highlight AD-Loop as a principled and broadly applicable strategy for synergizing comprehension and creation. The project page is at https://sqwu.top/AD-Loop.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new VLLMs/MLLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Proposes a new interleaved analyzing-drafting loop for unified vision-language models, improving synergy between understanding and generation with a novel training strategy.

## 9. [Global-Local Dual Perception for MLLMs in High-Resolution Text-Rich Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21956) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21956
**Authors:** Junxin Lu, Tengfei Song, Zhanglin Wu, Pengfei Li, Xiaowei Liang, Hui Yang, Kun Chen, Ning Xie, Yunfei Lu, Jing Zhao, Shiliang Sun, Daimeng Wei

**Abstract:**  Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate text embedded in images in the source-language into target-language, requiring synergistic integration of visual perception and linguistic understanding. Existing TIMT methods, whether cascaded pipelines or end-to-end multimodal large language models (MLLMs),struggle with high-resolution text-rich images due to cluttered layouts, diverse fonts, and non-textual distractions, resulting in text omission, semantic drift, and contextual inconsistency. To address these challenges, we propose GLoTran, a global-local dual visual perception framework for MLLM-based TIMT. GLoTran integrates a low-resolution global image with multi-scale region-level text image slices under an instruction-guided alignment strategy, conditioning MLLMs to maintain scene-level contextual consistency while faithfully capturing fine-grained textual details. Moreover, to realize this dual-perception paradigm, we construct GLoD, a large-scale text-rich TIMT dataset comprising 510K high-resolution global-local image-text pairs covering diverse real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GLoTran substantially improves translation completeness and accuracy over state-of-the-art MLLMs, offering a new paradigm for fine-grained TIMT under high-resolution and text-rich conditions.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new MLLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Proposes a new global-local dual perception framework for MLLM-based text image machine translation, with a new large-scale dataset and improved empirical results on high-res, text-rich images.

## 10. [See It, Say It, Sorted: An Iterative Training-Free Framework for Visually-Grounded Multimodal Reasoning in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21497) <a id="link10"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21497
**Authors:** Yongchang Zhang, Xianzheng Ma, Tianyi Liu, Guangquan Zhou, Yang Chen

**Abstract:**  Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning ability by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) responses. However, CoT reasoning in multimodal contexts is highly vulnerable to visual hallucination propagation: once an intermediate reasoning step becomes inconsistent with the visual evidence, subsequent steps-even if logically valid-can still lead to incorrect final answers. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this issue by training models to "think with images" via reinforcement learning (RL). While effective, these methods are costly, model-specific, and difficult to generalize across architectures. Differently, we present a lightweight method that bypasses RL training and provides an iterative, training-free, plug-and-play framework for visually-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our key idea is to supervise each reasoning step at test time with visual evidence, ensuring that every decoded token is justified by corresponding visual cues. Concretely, we construct a textual visual-evidence pool that guides the model's reasoning generation. When existing evidence is insufficient, a visual decider module dynamically extracts additional relevant evidence from the image based on the ongoing reasoning context, expanding the pool until the model achieves sufficient visual certainty to terminate reasoning and produce the final answer. Extensive experiments on multiple LVLM backbones and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method achieves 16.5%-29.5% improvements on TreeBench and 13.7% RH-AUC gains on RH-Bench, substantially reducing hallucination rates while improving reasoning accuracy without additional training.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new method for LVLMs/VLLMs, with a clever, training-free framework for visually-grounded multimodal reasoning and hallucination reduction).

## 11. [Scan Clusters, Not Pixels: A Cluster-Centric Paradigm for Efficient Ultra-high-definition Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21917) <a id="link11"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21917
**Authors:** Chen Wu, Ling Wang, Zhuoran Zheng, Yuning Cui, Zhixiong Yang, Xiangyu Chen, Yue Zhang, Weidong Jiang, Jingyuan Xia

**Abstract:**  Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image restoration is trapped in a scalability crisis: existing models, bound to pixel-wise operations, demand unsustainable computation. While state space models (SSMs) like Mamba promise linear complexity, their pixel-serial scanning remains a fundamental bottleneck for the millions of pixels in UHD content. We ask: must we process every pixel to understand the image? This paper introduces C$^2$SSM, a visual state space model that breaks this taboo by shifting from pixel-serial to cluster-serial scanning. Our core discovery is that the rich feature distribution of a UHD image can be distilled into a sparse set of semantic centroids via a neural-parameterized mixture model. C$^2$SSM leverages this to reformulate global modeling into a novel dual-path process: it scans and reasons over a handful of cluster centers, then diffuses the global context back to all pixels through a principled similarity distribution, all while a lightweight modulator preserves fine details. This cluster-centric paradigm achieves a decisive leap in efficiency, slashing computational costs while establishing new state-of-the-art results across five UHD restoration tasks. More than a solution, C$^2$SSM charts a new course for efficient large-scale vision: scan clusters, not pixels.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications), and is also a methodological improvement in spatial understanding (criterion 1) by introducing a cluster-centric paradigm for efficient UHD image restoration.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21929
**Authors:** JiaKui Hu, Jialun Liu, Liying Yang, Xinliang Zhang, Kaiwen Li, Shuang Zeng, Yuanwei Li, Haibin Huang, Chi Zhang, Yanye Lu

**Abstract:**  Scene-consistent video generation aims to create videos that explore 3D scenes based on a camera trajectory. Previous methods rely on video generation models with external memory for consistency, or iterative 3D reconstruction and inpainting, which accumulate errors during inference due to incorrect intermediary outputs, non-differentiable processes, and separate models. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ``geometry-as-context". It iteratively completes the following steps using an autoregressive camera-controlled video generation model: (1) estimates the geometry of the current view necessary for 3D reconstruction, and (2) simulates and restores novel view images rendered by the 3D scene. Under this multi-task framework, we develop the camera gated attention module to enhance the model's capability to effectively leverage camera poses. During the training phase, text contexts are utilized to ascertain whether geometric or RGB images should be generated. To ensure that the model can generate RGB-only outputs during inference, the geometry context is randomly dropped from the interleaved text-image-geometry training sequence. The method has been tested on scene video generation with one-direction and forth-and-back trajectories. The results show its superiority over previous approaches in maintaining scene consistency and camera control.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 1 (new methodological improvements to spatial understanding in video generation with explicit 3D geometry context) and 4 (vision foundation models and applications, as it relates to scene-consistent video generation). The use of geometry-as-context and camera gated attention for 3D scene-consistent video generation is a novel approach.

## 13. [RobustVisRAG: Causality-Aware Vision-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation under Visual Degradations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22013) <a id="link13"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.22013
**Authors:** I-Hsiang Chen, Yu-Wei Liu, Tse-Yu Wu, Yu-Chien Chiang, Jen-Chien Yang, Wei-Ting Chen

**Abstract:**  Vision-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VisRAG) leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to jointly retrieve relevant visual documents and generate grounded answers based on multimodal evidence. However, existing VisRAG models degrade in performance when visual inputs suffer from distortions such as blur, noise, low light, or shadow, where semantic and degradation factors become entangled within pretrained visual encoders, leading to errors in both retrieval and generation stages. To address this limitation, we introduce RobustVisRAG, a causality-guided dual-path framework that improves VisRAG robustness while preserving efficiency and zero-shot generalization. RobustVisRAG uses a non-causal path to capture degradation signals through unidirectional attention and a causal path to learn purified semantics guided by these signals. Together with the proposed Non-Causal Distortion Modeling and Causal Semantic Alignment objectives, the framework enforces a clear separation between semantics and degradations, enabling stable retrieval and generation under challenging visual conditions. To evaluate robustness under realistic conditions, we introduce the Distortion-VisRAG dataset, a large-scale benchmark containing both synthetic and real-world degraded documents across seven domains, with 12 synthetic and 5 real distortion types that comprehensively reflect practical visual degradations. Experimental results show that RobustVisRAG improves retrieval, generation, and end-to-end performance by 7.35%, 6.35%, and 12.40%, respectively, on real-world degradations, while maintaining comparable accuracy on clean inputs.

**Comment:** Introduces RobustVisRAG, a causality-aware framework for vision-based retrieval-augmented generation under visual degradations, and a new benchmark. Closely matches criterion 2 (VLLMs/MLLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications).

## 14. [WHOLE: World-Grounded Hand-Object Lifted from Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22209) <a id="link14"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.22209
**Authors:** Yufei Ye, Jiaman Li, Ryan Rong, C. Karen Liu

**Abstract:**  Egocentric manipulation videos are highly challenging due to severe occlusions during interactions and frequent object entries and exits from the camera view as the person moves. Current methods typically focus on recovering either hand or object pose in isolation, but both struggle during interactions and fail to handle out-of-sight cases. Moreover, their independent predictions often lead to inconsistent hand-object relations. We introduce WHOLE, a method that holistically reconstructs hand and object motion in world space from egocentric videos given object templates. Our key insight is to learn a generative prior over hand-object motion to jointly reason about their interactions. At test time, the pretrained prior is guided to generate trajectories that conform to the video observations. This joint generative reconstruction substantially outperforms approaches that process hands and objects separately followed by post-processing. WHOLE achieves state-of-the-art performance on hand motion estimation, 6D object pose estimation, and their relative interaction reconstruction. Project website: https://judyye.github.io/whole-www

**Comment:** Proposes a generative prior for joint hand-object motion reconstruction from egocentric videos, focusing on holistic spatial understanding and interaction.

## 15. [Beyond Static Artifacts: A Forensic Benchmark for Video Deepfake Reasoning in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21779) <a id="link15"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21779
**Authors:** Zheyuan Gu, Qingsong Zhao, Yusong Wang, Zhaohong Huang, Xinqi Li, Cheng Yuan, Jiaowei Shao, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li

**Abstract:**  Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for deepfake detection excel at identifying spatial artifacts but overlook a critical dimension: temporal inconsistencies in video forgeries. Adapting VLMs to reason about these dynamic cues remains a distinct challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Forensic Answer-Questioning (FAQ), a large-scale benchmark that formulates temporal deepfake analysis as a multiple-choice task. FAQ introduces a three-level hierarchy to progressively evaluate and equip VLMs with forensic capabilities: (1) Facial Perception, testing the ability to identify static visual artifacts; (2) Temporal Deepfake Grounding, requiring the localization of dynamic forgery artifacts across frames; and (3) Forensic Reasoning, challenging models to synthesize evidence for final authenticity verdicts. We evaluate a range of VLMs on FAQ and generate a corresponding instruction-tuning set, FAQ-IT. Extensive experiments show that models fine-tuned on FAQ-IT achieve advanced performance on both in-domain and cross-dataset detection benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the impact of our key design choices, confirming that FAQ is the driving force behind the temporal reasoning capabilities of these VLMs.

**Comment:** This paper introduces a new benchmark for temporal deepfake reasoning in VLMs, focusing on temporal inconsistencies and forensic reasoning. Closely matches criterion 3 (new benchmark for embodied AI/VLMs with a novel angle: temporal reasoning in deepfakes) and criterion 2 (VLLMs).

## 16. [A Hidden Semantic Bottleneck in Conditional Embeddings of Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21596) <a id="link16"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21596
**Authors:** Trung X. Pham, Kang Zhang, Ji Woo Hong, Chang D. Yoo

**Abstract:**  Diffusion Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in class-conditional and multimodal generation, yet the structure of their learned conditional embeddings remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first systematic study of these embeddings and uncover a notable redundancy: class-conditioned embeddings exhibit extreme angular similarity, exceeding 99\% on ImageNet-1K, while continuous-condition tasks such as pose-guided image generation and video-to-audio generation reach over 99.9\%. We further find that semantic information is concentrated in a small subset of dimensions, with head dimensions carrying the dominant signal and tail dimensions contributing minimally. By pruning low-magnitude dimensions--removing up to two-thirds of the embedding space--we show that generation quality and fidelity remain largely unaffected, and in some cases improve. These results reveal a semantic bottleneck in Transformer-based diffusion models, providing new insights into how semantics are encoded and suggesting opportunities for more efficient conditioning mechanisms.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and their internal mechanisms), as it analyzes conditional embeddings in diffusion transformers for multi-modal generation. The discovery of a semantic bottleneck and redundancy in embeddings is an insightful empirical result.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21406
**Authors:** Asim Unmesh, Kaki Ramesh, Mayank Patel, Rahul Jain, Karthik Ramani

**Abstract:**  Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS) requires dividing videos into action segments, yet the vast space of activities and alternative breakdowns makes collecting comprehensive datasets infeasible. Existing methods remain limited to closed vocabularies and fixed label sets. In this work, we explore the largely unexplored problem of Open-Vocabulary Zero-Shot Temporal Action Segmentation (OVTAS) by leveraging the strong zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce a training-free pipeline that follows a segmentation-by-classification design: Frame-Action Embedding Similarity (FAES) matches video frames to candidate action labels, and Similarity-Matrix Temporal Segmentation (SMTS) enforces temporal consistency. Beyond proposing OVTAS, we present a systematic study across 14 diverse VLMs, providing the first broad analysis of their suitability for open-vocabulary action segmentation. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that OVTAS achieves strong results without task-specific supervision, underscoring the potential of VLMs for structured temporal understanding.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (systematic study of VLMs for open-vocabulary zero-shot action segmentation) and criterion 4 (application of vision foundation models to temporal action segmentation). The paper provides a broad empirical analysis of VLMs for a new task.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21743
**Authors:** Jinghan Li, Junfeng Fang, Jinda Lu, Yuan Wang, Xiaoyan Guo, Tianyu Zhang, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He

**Abstract:**  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models. Extending these methods to multimodal settings, however, faces a critical challenge: the instability of std-based normalization, which is easily distorted by extreme samples with nearly positive or negative rewards. Unlike pure-text LLMs, multimodal models are particularly sensitive to such distortions, as both perceptual and reasoning errors influence their responses. To address this, we characterize each sample by its difficulty, defined through perceptual complexity (measured via visual entropy) and reasoning uncertainty (captured by model confidence). Building on this characterization, we propose difficulty-aware group normalization (Durian), which re-groups samples by difficulty levels and shares the std within each group. Our approach preserves GRPO's intra-group distinctions while eliminating sensitivity to extreme cases, yielding significant performance gains across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new methods for improving MLLMs, specifically reasoning in multi-modal LLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models, as it addresses normalization in multi-modal reasoning). The difficulty-aware group normalization is a novel statistical trick for MLLMs.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21778
**Authors:** Liangbing Zhao, Le Zhuo, Sayak Paul, Hongsheng Li, Mohamed Elhoseiny

**Abstract:**  Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable success in semantic alignment, yet state-of-the-art models frequently fail to render physically plausible results when editing involves complex causal dynamics, such as refraction or material deformation. We attribute this limitation to the dominant paradigm that treats editing as a discrete mapping between image pairs, which provides only boundary conditions and leaves transition dynamics underspecified. To address this, we reformulate physics-aware editing as predictive physical state transitions and introduce PhysicTran38K, a large-scale video-based dataset comprising 38K transition trajectories across five physical domains, constructed via a two-stage filtering and constraint-aware annotation pipeline. Building on this supervision, we propose PhysicEdit, an end-to-end framework equipped with a textual-visual dual-thinking mechanism. It combines a frozen Qwen2.5-VL for physically grounded reasoning with learnable transition queries that provide timestep-adaptive visual guidance to a diffusion backbone. Experiments show that PhysicEdit improves over Qwen-Image-Edit by 5.9% in physical realism and 10.1% in knowledge-grounded editing, setting a new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, while remaining competitive with leading proprietary models.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) and partially criterion 2 (uses Qwen2.5-VL, a VLLM, for physically grounded reasoning in image editing). The paper introduces a new dataset and a method for physics-aware image editing, which is a novel application of VLLMs.

## 20. [SAPNet++: Evolving Point-Prompted Instance Segmentation with Semantic and Spatial Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21762) <a id="link20"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21762
**Authors:** Zhaoyang Wei, Xumeng Han, Xuehui Yu, Xue Yang, Guorong Li, Zhenjun Han, Jianbin Jiao

**Abstract:**  Single-point annotation is increasingly prominent in visual tasks for labeling cost reduction. However, it challenges tasks requiring high precision, such as the point-prompted instance segmentation (PPIS) task, which aims to estimate precise masks using single-point prompts to train a segmentation network. Due to the constraints of point annotations, granularity ambiguity and boundary uncertainty arise the difficulty distinguishing between different levels of detail (eg. whole object vs. parts) and the challenge of precisely delineating object boundaries. Previous works have usually inherited the paradigm of mask generation along with proposal selection to achieve PPIS. However, proposal selection relies solely on category information, failing to resolve the ambiguity of different granularity. Furthermore, mask generators offer only finite discrete solutions that often deviate from actual masks, particularly at boundaries. To address these issues, we propose the Semantic-Aware Point-Prompted Instance Segmentation Network (SAPNet). It integrates Point Distance Guidance and Box Mining Strategy to tackle group and local issues caused by the point's granularity ambiguity. Additionally, we incorporate completeness scores within proposals to add spatial granularity awareness, enhancing multiple instance learning (MIL) in proposal selection termed S-MIL. The Multi-level Affinity Refinement conveys pixel and semantic clues, narrowing boundary uncertainty during mask refinement. These modules culminate in SAPNet++, mitigating point prompt's granularity ambiguity and boundary uncertainty and significantly improving segmentation performance. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets validate the effectiveness of our methods, highlighting the potential to advance PPIS.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (spatial understanding in segmentation with spatial and semantic awareness) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models, as it builds on segmentation networks and foundation models for point-prompted instance segmentation). The method introduces spatial granularity awareness and multi-level affinity refinement, which are methodological improvements for spatial intelligence.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21716
**Authors:** Wenbin Wang, Yuge Huang, Jianqing Xu, Yue Yu, Jiangtao Yan, Shouhong Ding, Pan Zhou, Yong Luo

**Abstract:**  Rapid advances in AI-generated image (AIGI) technology enable highly realistic synthesis, threatening public information integrity and security. Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating texture-level artifact features alongside semantic features into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can enhance their AIGI detection capability. However, our preliminary analyses reveal that artifact features exhibit high intra-feature similarity, leading to an almost uniform attention map after the softmax operation. This phenomenon causes attention dilution, thereby hindering effective fusion between semantic and artifact features. To overcome this limitation, we propose a lightweight fusion adapter, TranX-Adapter, which integrates a Task-aware Optimal-Transport Fusion that leverages the Jensen-Shannon divergence between artifact and semantic prediction probabilities as a cost matrix to transfer artifact information into semantic features, and an X-Fusion that employs cross-attention to transfer semantic information into artifact features. Experiments on standard AIGI detection benchmarks upon several advanced MLLMs, show that our TranX-Adapter brings consistent and significant improvements (up to +6% accuracy).

**Authors:** Xiaoxuan Wang, Han Zhang, Haixin Wang, Yidan Shi, Ruoyan Li, Kaiqiao Han, Chenyi Tong, Haoran Deng, Renliang Sun, Alexander Taylor, Yanqiao Zhu, Jason Cong, Yizhou Sun, Wei Wang

**Abstract:**  Agentic reinforcement learning (ARL) has rapidly gained attention as a promising paradigm for training agents to solve complex, multi-step interactive tasks. Despite encouraging early results, ARL remains highly unstable, often leading to training collapse. This instability limits scalability to larger environments and longer interaction horizons, and constrains systematic exploration of algorithmic design choices. In this paper, we first propose ARLArena, a stable training recipe and systematic analysis framework that examines training stability in a controlled and reproducible setting. ARLArena first constructs a clean and standardized testbed. Then, we decompose policy gradient into four core design dimensions and assess the performance and stability of each dimension. Through this fine-grained analysis, we distill a unified perspective on ARL and propose SAMPO, a stable agentic policy optimization method designed to mitigate the dominant sources of instability in ARL. Empirically, SAMPO achieves consistently stable training and strong performance across diverse agentic tasks. Overall, this study provides a unifying policy gradient perspective for ARL and offers practical guidance for building stable and reproducible LLM-based agent training pipelines.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21735
**Authors:** Jiayi Wang, Hadrien Reynaud, Ibrahim Ethem Hamamci, Sezgin Er, Suprosanna Shit, Bjoern Menze, Bernhard Kainz

**Abstract:**  Large-scale, volumetric medical imaging datasets typically aggregate scans from different vendors and devices, resulting in highly variable resolution, slice thicknesses, and numbers of slices per study. Consequently, training representation models usually requires cropping or interpolating along the z-axis to obtain fixed-size blocks, which inevitably causes information loss. We propose a new training approach to overcome this limitation. Instead of absolute position embeddings, we interpret volumes as sequences of 3D chunks and adopt Rotary Position Embeddings, allowing us to treat the z-axis as an unconstrained temporal dimensions. Building on this idea, we introduce a new vision-language model: SigVLP. In SigVLP, we implement Rotary Position Embedding as the positional encoding method, which is applied directly within the attention operation, generating input-conditioned sine and cosine weights on the fly. This design ensures consistent alignment between query and key projections and adapts to any input sizes. To allow for variable input size during training, we sample Computed Tomography volumes in chunks and pair them with localized organ-wise textual observations. Compared to using entire reports for conditioning, chunkwise alignment provides finer-grained supervision, enabling the model to establish stronger correlations between the text and volume representations, thereby improving the precision of text-to-volume alignment. Our models are trained with the Muon optimizer and evaluated on a diverse set of downstream tasks, including zero-shot abnormality and organ classification, segmentation, and retrieval tasks.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new VLLMs/MLLMs). Proposes SigVLP, a new vision-language model for volumetric medical imaging with a novel positional encoding and chunkwise alignment for fine-grained supervision. Relevant for multi-modal learning and vision-language modeling.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.22025
**Authors:** Shuang Song, Debao Huang, Deyan Deng, Haolin Xiong, Yang Tang, Yajie Zhao, Rongjun Qin

**Abstract:**  Intrinsic image decomposition (IID) of outdoor scenes is crucial for relighting, editing, and understanding large-scale environments, but progress has been limited by the lack of real-world datasets with reliable albedo and shading supervision. We introduce Olbedo, a large-scale aerial dataset for outdoor albedo--shading decomposition in the wild. Olbedo contains 5,664 UAV images captured across four landscape types, multiple years, and diverse illumination conditions. Each view is accompanied by multi-view consistent albedo and shading maps, metric depth, surface normals, sun and sky shading components, camera poses, and, for recent flights, measured HDR sky domes. These annotations are derived from an inverse-rendering refinement pipeline over multi-view stereo reconstructions and calibrated sky illumination, together with per-pixel confidence masks. We demonstrate that Olbedo enables state-of-the-art diffusion-based IID models, originally trained on synthetic indoor data, to generalize to real outdoor imagery: fine-tuning on Olbedo significantly improves single-view outdoor albedo prediction on the MatrixCity benchmark. We further illustrate applications of Olbedo-trained models to multi-view consistent relighting of 3D assets, material editing, and scene change analysis for urban digital twins. We release the dataset, baseline models, and an evaluation protocol to support future research in outdoor intrinsic decomposition and illumination-aware aerial vision.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21893
**Authors:** Yinheng Lin, Yiming Huang, Beilei Cui, Long Bai, Huxin Gao, Hongliang Ren, Jiewen Lai

**Abstract:**  Accurate depth estimation plays a critical role in the navigation of endoscopic surgical robots, forming the foundation for 3D reconstruction and safe instrument guidance. Fine-tuning pretrained models heavily relies on endoscopic surgical datasets with precise depth annotations. While existing self-supervised depth estimation techniques eliminate the need for accurate depth annotations, their performance degrades in environments with weak textures and variable lighting, leading to sparse reconstruction with invalid depth estimation. Depth completion using sparse depth maps can mitigate these issues and improve accuracy. Despite the advances in depth completion techniques in general fields, their application in endoscopy remains limited. To overcome these limitations, we propose EndoDDC, an endoscopy depth completion method that integrates images, sparse depth information with depth gradient features, and optimizes depth maps through a diffusion model, addressing the issues of weak texture and light reflection in endoscopic environments. Extensive experiments on two publicly available endoscopy datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in both depth accuracy and robustness. This demonstrates the potential of our method to reduce visual errors in complex endoscopic environments. Our code will be released at https://github.com/yinheng-lin/EndoDDC.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21810
**Authors:** Xiankang He, Peile Lin, Ying Cui, Dongyan Guo, Chunhua Shen, Xiaoqin Zhang

**Abstract:**  Motion segmentation in dynamic scenes is highly challenging, as conventional methods heavily rely on estimating camera poses and point correspondences from inherently noisy motion cues. Existing statistical inference or iterative optimization techniques that struggle to mitigate the cumulative errors in multi-stage pipelines often lead to limited performance or high computational cost. In contrast, we propose a fully learning-based approach that directly infers moving objects from latent feature representations via attention mechanisms, thus enabling end-to-end feed-forward motion segmentation. Our key insight is to bypass explicit correspondence estimation and instead let the model learn to implicitly disentangle object and camera motion. Supported by recent advances in 4D scene geometry reconstruction (e.g., $\pi^3$), the proposed method leverages reliable camera poses and rich spatial-temporal priors, which ensure stable training and robust inference for the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by eliminating complex pre-processing and iterative refinement, our approach achieves state-of-the-art motion segmentation performance with high efficiency. The code is available at:https://github.com/zjutcvg/GeoMotion.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21273
**Authors:** Jinghao Hu, Yuhe Zhang, GuoHua Geng, Kang Li, Han Zhang

**Abstract:**  Generating multi-frame, action-rich visual narratives without fine-tuning faces a threefold tension: action text faithfulness, subject identity fidelity, and cross-frame background continuity. We propose StoryTailor, a zero-shot pipeline that runs on a single RTX 4090 (24 GB) and produces temporally coherent, identity-preserving image sequences from a long narrative prompt, per-subject references, and grounding boxes. Three synergistic modules drive the system: Gaussian-Centered Attention (GCA) to dynamically focus on each subject core and ease grounding-box overlaps; Action-Boost Singular Value Reweighting (AB-SVR) to amplify action-related directions in the text embedding space; and Selective Forgetting Cache (SFC) that retains transferable background cues, forgets nonessential history, and selectively surfaces retained cues to build cross-scene semantic ties. Compared with baseline methods, experiments show that CLIP-T improves by up to 10-15%, with DreamSim lower than strong baselines, while CLIP-I stays in a visually acceptable, competitive range. With matched resolution and steps on a 24 GB GPU, inference is faster than FluxKontext. Qualitatively, StoryTailor delivers expressive interactions and evolving yet stable scenes.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21754
**Authors:** Aditya Ranjan Dash, Ramy Battrawy, Ren\'e Schuster, Didier Stricker

**Abstract:**  Advanced autonomous systems rely on multi-sensor fusion for safer and more robust perception. To enable effective fusion, calibrating directly from natural driving scenes (i.e., target-free) with high accuracy is crucial for precise multi-sensor alignment. Existing learning-based calibration methods are typically designed for only a single pair of sensor modalities (i.e., a bi-modal setup). Unlike these methods, we propose LiREC-Net, a target-free, learning-based calibration network that jointly calibrates multiple sensor modality pairs, including LiDAR, RGB, and event data, within a unified framework. To reduce redundant computation and improve efficiency, we introduce a shared LiDAR representation that leverages features from both its 3D nature and projected depth map, ensuring better consistency across modalities. Trained and evaluated on established datasets, such as KITTI and DSEC, our LiREC-Net achieves competitive performance to bi-modal models and sets a new strong baseline for the tri-modal use case.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 1 (methodological improvements to spatial intelligence on embodied agents) and 3 (multi-modal calibration, new method for tri-modal sensor calibration). The paper proposes a unified, target-free calibration network for LiDAR, RGB, and event data, which is a novel angle in sensor fusion.

## 29. [RGB-Event HyperGraph Prompt for Kilometer Marker Recognition based on Pre-trained Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22026) <a id="link29"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.22026
**Authors:** Xiaoyu Xian, Shiao Wang, Xiao Wang, Daxin Tian, Yan Tian

**Abstract:**  Metro trains often operate in highly complex environments, characterized by illumination variations, high-speed motion, and adverse weather conditions. These factors pose significant challenges for visual perception systems, especially those relying solely on conventional RGB cameras. To tackle these difficulties, we explore the integration of event cameras into the perception system, leveraging their advantages in low-light conditions, high-speed scenarios, and low power consumption. Specifically, we focus on Kilometer Marker Recognition (KMR), a critical task for autonomous metro localization under GNSS-denied conditions. In this context, we propose a robust baseline method based on a pre-trained RGB OCR foundation model, enhanced through multi-modal adaptation. Furthermore, we construct the first large-scale RGB-Event dataset, EvMetro5K, containing 5,599 pairs of synchronized RGB-Event samples, split into 4,479 training and 1,120 testing samples. Extensive experiments on EvMetro5K and other widely used benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for KMR. Both the dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/EvMetro5K_benchmark

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications), as it adapts a pre-trained OCR foundation model for multi-modal (RGB + event) perception in challenging environments. Also relevant to spatial intelligence in embodied agents (criterion 1) for metro train localization.

## 30. [IHF-Harmony: Multi-Modality Magnetic Resonance Images Harmonization using Invertible Hierarchy Flow Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21536) <a id="link30"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21536
**Authors:** Pengli Zhu, Yitao Zhu, Haowen Pang, Anqi Qiu

**Abstract:**  Retrospective MRI harmonization is limited by poor scalability across modalities and reliance on traveling subject datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce IHF-Harmony, a unified invertible hierarchy flow framework for multi-modality harmonization using unpaired data. By decomposing the translation process into reversible feature transformations, IHF-Harmony guarantees bijective mapping and lossless reconstruction to prevent anatomical distortion. Specifically, an invertible hierarchy flow (IHF) performs hierarchical subtractive coupling to progressively remove artefact-related features, while an artefact-aware normalization (AAN) employs anatomy-fixed feature modulation to accurately transfer target characteristics. Combined with anatomy and artefact consistency loss objectives, IHF-Harmony achieves high-fidelity harmonization that retains source anatomy. Experiments across multiple MRI modalities demonstrate that IHF-Harmony outperforms existing methods in both anatomical fidelity and downstream task performance, facilitating robust harmonization for large-scale multi-site imaging studies. Code will be released upon acceptance.

**Comment:** Relevant to vision foundation models (criterion 4) in the medical imaging domain, with a new invertible flow model for MRI harmonization.

## 31. [MedTri: A Platform for Structured Medical Report Normalization to Enhance Vision-Language Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22143) <a id="link31"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.22143
**Authors:** Yuetan Chu, Xinhua Ma, Xinran Jin, Gongning Luo, Xin Gao

**Abstract:**  Medical vision-language pretraining increasingly relies on medical reports as large-scale supervisory signals; however, raw reports often exhibit substantial stylistic heterogeneity, variable length, and a considerable amount of image-irrelevant content. Although text normalization is frequently adopted as a preprocessing step in prior work, its design principles and empirical impact on vision-language pretraining remain insufficiently and systematically examined. In this study, we present MedTri, a deployable normalization framework for medical vision-language pretraining that converts free-text reports into a unified [Anatomical Entity: Radiologic Description + Diagnosis Category] triplet. This structured, anatomy-grounded normalization preserves essential morphological and spatial information while removing stylistic noise and image-irrelevant content, providing consistent and image-grounded textual supervision at scale. Across multiple datasets spanning both X-ray and computed tomography (CT) modalities, we demonstrate that structured, anatomy-grounded text normalization is an important factor in medical vision-language pretraining quality, yielding consistent improvements over raw reports and existing normalization baselines. In addition, we illustrate how this normalization can easily support modular text-level augmentation strategies, including knowledge enrichment and anatomy-grounded counterfactual supervision, which provide complementary gains in robustness and generalization without altering the core normalization process. Together, our results position structured text normalization as a critical and generalizable preprocessing component for medical vision-language learning, while MedTri provides this normalization platform. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/Arturia-Pendragon-Iris/MedTri.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications), specifically in the medical domain, by introducing a normalization platform to improve vision-language pretraining. The work is focused on preprocessing and structured supervision for medical VLMs.

## 32. [StoryMovie: A Dataset for Semantic Alignment of Visual Stories with Movie Scripts and Subtitles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21829) <a id="link32"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21829
**Authors:** Daniel Oliveira, David Martins de Matos

**Abstract:**  Visual storytelling models that correctly ground entities in images may still hallucinate semantic relationships, generating incorrect dialogue attribution, character interactions, or emotional states. We introduce StoryMovie, a dataset of 1,757 stories aligned with movie scripts and subtitles through LCS matching. Our alignment pipeline synchronizes screenplay dialogue with subtitle timestamps, enabling dialogue attribution by linking character names from scripts to temporal positions from subtitles. Using this aligned content, we generate stories that maintain visual grounding tags while incorporating authentic character names, dialogue, and relationship dynamics. We fine-tune Qwen Storyteller3 on this dataset, building on prior work in visual grounding and entity re-identification. Evaluation using DeepSeek V3 as judge shows that Storyteller3 achieves an 89.9% win rate against base Qwen2.5-VL 7B on subtitle alignment. Compared to Storyteller, trained without script grounding,   Storyteller3 achieves 48.5% versus 38.0%, confirming that semantic alignment progressively improves dialogue attribution beyond visual grounding alone.

**Comment:** This paper introduces a dataset for aligning visual stories with movie scripts and subtitles, improving semantic alignment and dialogue attribution. While relevant to vision-language grounding, it does not directly match the criteria for new VLLMs/MLLMs, spatial intelligence, or embodied AI.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.22197
**Authors:** Xavier Pleimling, Sifat Muhammad Abdullah, Gunjan Balde, Peng Gao, Mainack Mondal, Murtuza Jadliwala, Bimal Viswanath

**Abstract:**  Advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to the development of various protection strategies to prevent the unauthorized use of images. These methods rely on adding imperceptible protective perturbations to images to thwart misuse such as style mimicry or deepfake manipulations. Although previous attacks on these protections required specialized, purpose-built methods, we demonstrate that this is no longer necessary. We show that off-the-shelf image-to-image GenAI models can be repurposed as generic ``denoisers" using a simple text prompt, effectively removing a wide range of protective perturbations. Across 8 case studies spanning 6 diverse protection schemes, our general-purpose attack not only circumvents these defenses but also outperforms existing specialized attacks while preserving the image's utility for the adversary. Our findings reveal a critical and widespread vulnerability in the current landscape of image protection, indicating that many schemes provide a false sense of security. We stress the urgent need to develop robust defenses and establish that any future protection mechanism must be benchmarked against attacks from off-the-shelf GenAI models. Code is available in this repository: https://github.com/mlsecviswanath/img2imgdenoiser

**Comment:** This paper demonstrates that off-the-shelf image-to-image generative models can defeat image protection schemes. While relevant to generative modeling and vision, it does not match the specific criteria of spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21699
**Authors:** Rajai Alhimdiat, Ramy Battrawy, Ren\'e Schuster, Didier Stricker, Wesam Ashour

**Abstract:**  Scene flow estimation is an extremely important task in computer vision to support the perception of dynamic changes in the scene. For robust scene flow, learning-based approaches have recently achieved impressive results using either image-based or LiDAR-based modalities. However, these methods have tended to focus on the use of a single modality. To tackle these problems, we present a deep learning architecture, SF3D-RGB, that enables sparse scene flow estimation using 2D monocular images and 3D point clouds (e.g., acquired by LiDAR) as inputs. Our architecture is an end-to-end model that first encodes information from each modality into features and fuses them together. Then, the fused features enhance a graph matching module for better and more robust mapping matrix computation to generate an initial scene flow. Finally, a residual scene flow module further refines the initial scene flow. Our model is designed to strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, experiments show that our proposed method outperforms single-modality methods and achieves better scene flow accuracy on real-world datasets while using fewer parameters compared to other state-of-the-art methods with fusion.

**Comment:** Presents a new method for scene flow estimation using both monocular images and sparse LiDAR. This is a methodological improvement in multi-modal fusion for spatial understanding, but not directly about embodied agents or VLLMs/MLLMs. Closest to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications), but not a direct match.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21627
**Authors:** Abhineet Singh, Justin Rozeboom, Nilanjan Ray

**Abstract:**  This paper presents a new unified approach to semantic segmentation in both images and videos by using language modeling to output the masks as sequences of discrete tokens. We use run length encoding (RLE) to discretize the segmentation masks and then train a modified version of Pix2Seq \cite{p2s} to output these RLE tokens through autoregression. We propose novel tokenization strategies to compress the length of the token sequence to make it practicable to extend this approach to videos. We also show how instance information can be incorporated into the tokenization process to perform panoptic segmentation. We evaluate our proposed models on two datasets to show that they are competitive with the state of the art in spite of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a new method for semantic segmentation by tokenizing masks as sequences, using RLE and a modified Pix2Seq. It is a methodological improvement in spatial understanding, but not directly on embodied agents or spatial intelligence in agents. Closest to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications), but not a direct match.

**Authors:** Dominik Schneider, Lalithkumar Seenivasan, Sampath Rapuri, Vishalroshan Anil, Aiza Maksutova, Yiqing Shen, Jan Emily Mangulabnan, Hao Ding, Jose L. Porras, Masaru Ishii, Mathias Unberath

**Abstract:**  Purpose: Curating large-scale datasets of operating room (OR) workflow, encompassing rare, safety-critical, or atypical events, remains operationally and ethically challenging. This data bottleneck complicates the development of ambient intelligence for detecting, understanding, and mitigating rare or safety-critical events in the OR.   Methods: This work presents an OR video diffusion framework that enables controlled synthesis of rare and safety-critical events. The framework integrates a geometric abstraction module, a conditioning module, and a fine-tuned diffusion model to first transform OR scenes into abstract geometric representations, then condition the synthesis process, and finally generate realistic OR event videos. Using this framework, we also curate a synthetic dataset to train and validate AI models for detecting near-misses of sterile-field violations.   Results: In synthesizing routine OR events, our method outperforms off-the-shelf video diffusion baselines, achieving lower FVD/LPIPS and higher SSIM/PSNR in both in- and out-of-domain datasets. Through qualitative results, we illustrate its ability for controlled video synthesis of counterfactual events. An AI model trained and validated on the generated synthetic data achieved a RECALL of 70.13% in detecting near safety-critical events. Finally, we conduct an ablation study to quantify performance gains from key design choices.   Conclusion: Our solution enables controlled synthesis of routine and rare OR events from abstract geometric representations. Beyond demonstrating its capability to generate rare and safety-critical scenarios, we show its potential to support the development of ambient intelligence models.

## 37. [GFPL: Generative Federated Prototype Learning for Resource-Constrained and Data-Imbalanced Vision Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21873) <a id="link37"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21873
**Authors:** Shiwei Lu, Yuhang He, Jiashuo Li, Qiang Wang, Yihong Gong

**Abstract:**  Federated learning (FL) facilitates the secure utilization of decentralized images, advancing applications in medical image recognition and autonomous driving. However, conventional FL faces two critical challenges in real-world deployment: ineffective knowledge fusion caused by model updates biased toward majority-class features, and prohibitive communication overhead due to frequent transmissions of high-dimensional model parameters. Inspired by the human brain's efficiency in knowledge integration, we propose a novel Generative Federated Prototype Learning (GFPL) framework to address these issues. Within this framework, a prototype generation method based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) captures the statistical information of class-wise features, while a prototype aggregation strategy using Bhattacharyya distance effectively fuses semantically similar knowledge across clients. In addition, these fused prototypes are leveraged to generate pseudo-features, thereby mitigating feature distribution imbalance across clients. To further enhance feature alignment during local training, we devise a dual-classifier architecture, optimized via a hybrid loss combining Dot Regression and Cross-Entropy. Extensive experiments on benchmarks show that GFPL improves model accuracy by 3.6% under imbalanced data settings while maintaining low communication cost.

**Comment:** Somewhat relevant to general interest in generative modeling and statistical tricks (prototype learning, federated learning), but does not directly match any specific criterion.

**Abstract:**  Understanding human visual attention is key to preserving cultural heritage We introduce SPGen a novel deep learning model to predict scanpaths the sequence of eye movementswhen viewers observe paintings.   Our architecture uses a Fully Convolutional Neural Network FCNN with differentiable fixation selection and learnable Gaussian priors to simulate natural viewing biases To address the domain gap between photographs and artworks we employ unsupervised domain adaptation via a gradient reversal layer allowing the model to transfer knowledge from natural scenes to paintings Furthermore a random noise sampler models the inherent stochasticity of eyetracking data.   Extensive testing shows SPGen outperforms existing methods offering a powerful tool to analyze gaze behavior and advance the preservation and appreciation of artistic treasures.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21496
**Authors:** Umid Suleymanov, Zaur Rajabov, Emil Mirzazada, Murat Kantarcioglu

**Abstract:**  While defenses for structured PII are mature, Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a new threat: Semantic Sensitive Information (SemSI), where models infer sensitive identity attributes, generate reputation-harmful content, or hallucinate potentially wrong information. The capacity of LLMs to self-regulate these complex, context-dependent sensitive information leaks without destroying utility remains an open scientific question. To address this, we introduce SemSIEdit, an inference-time framework where an agentic "Editor" iteratively critiques and rewrites sensitive spans to preserve narrative flow rather than simply refusing to answer. Our analysis reveals a Privacy-Utility Pareto Frontier, where this agentic rewriting reduces leakage by 34.6% across all three SemSI categories while incurring a marginal utility loss of 9.8%. We also uncover a Scale-Dependent Safety Divergence: large reasoning models (e.g., GPT-5) achieve safety through constructive expansion (adding nuance), whereas capacity-constrained models revert to destructive truncation (deleting text). Finally, we identify a Reasoning Paradox: while inference-time reasoning increases baseline risk by enabling the model to make deeper sensitive inferences, it simultaneously empowers the defense to execute safe rewrites.

**Comment:** Somewhat related to criterion 2 (LLMs), but focuses on privacy and self-correction in text, not vision or multi-modal models. Interesting empirical findings about LLM safety, but not a direct match to vision-language or embodied AI.

## 40. [Power and Limitations of Aggregation in Compound AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21556) <a id="link40"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21556
**Authors:** Nivasini Ananthakrishnan, Meena Jagadeesan

**Abstract:**  When designing compound AI systems, a common approach is to query multiple copies of the same model and aggregate the responses to produce a synthesized output. Given the homogeneity of these models, this raises the question of whether aggregation unlocks access to a greater set of outputs than querying a single model. In this work, we investigate the power and limitations of aggregation within a stylized principal-agent framework. This framework models how the system designer can partially steer each agent's output through its reward function specification, but still faces limitations due to prompt engineering ability and model capabilities. Our analysis uncovers three natural mechanisms -- feasibility expansion, support expansion, and binding set contraction -- through which aggregation expands the set of outputs that are elicitable by the system designer. We prove that any aggregation operation must implement one of these mechanisms in order to be elicitability-expanding, and that strengthened versions of these mechanisms provide necessary and sufficient conditions that fully characterize elicitability-expansion. Finally, we provide an empirical illustration of our findings for LLMs deployed in a toy reference-generation task. Altogether, our results take a step towards characterizing when compound AI systems can overcome limitations in model capabilities and in prompt engineering.

**Comment:** This paper analyzes aggregation in compound AI systems, focusing on theoretical mechanisms for expanding output elicitability. While interesting for general AI system design, it does not directly address spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21351
**Authors:** Dmitrii Pantiukhin, Ivan Kuznetsov, Boris Shapkin, Antonia Anna Jost, Thomas Jung, Nikolay Koldunov

**Abstract:**  The rapid accumulation of Earth science data has created a significant scalability challenge; while repositories like PANGAEA host vast collections of datasets, citation metrics indicate that a substantial portion remains underutilized, limiting data reusability. Here we present PANGAEA-GPT, a hierarchical multi-agent framework designed for autonomous data discovery and analysis. Unlike standard Large Language Model (LLM) wrappers, our architecture implements a centralized Supervisor-Worker topology with strict data-type-aware routing, sandboxed deterministic code execution, and self-correction via execution feedback, enabling agents to diagnose and resolve runtime errors. Through use-case scenarios spanning physical oceanography and ecology, we demonstrate the system's capacity to execute complex, multi-step workflows with minimal human intervention. This framework provides a methodology for querying and analyzing heterogeneous repository data through coordinated agent workflows.

**Comment:** Somewhat related to criteria 3 (multi-agent system for autonomous discovery, but not directly about embodied AI or simulators). Focuses on data discovery in geoscientific archives, not spatial intelligence or vision-language models.

## 42. [Meta-FC: Meta-Learning with Feature Consistency for Robust and Generalizable Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21849) <a id="link42"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21849
**Authors:** Yuheng Li, Weitong Chen, Chengcheng Zhu, Jiale Zhang, Chunpeng Ge, Di Wu, Guodong Long

**Abstract:**  Deep learning-based watermarking has made remarkable progress in recent years. To achieve robustness against various distortions, current methods commonly adopt a training strategy where a \underline{\textbf{s}}ingle \underline{\textbf{r}}andom \underline{\textbf{d}}istortion (SRD) is chosen as the noise layer in each training batch. However, the SRD strategy treats distortions independently within each batch, neglecting the inherent relationships among different types of distortions and causing optimization conflicts across batches. As a result, the robustness and generalizability of the watermarking model are limited. To address this issue, we propose a novel training strategy that enhances robustness and generalization via \underline{\textbf{meta}}-learning with \underline{\textbf{f}}eature \underline{\textbf{c}}onsistency (Meta-FC). Specifically, we randomly sample multiple distortions from the noise pool to construct a meta-training task, while holding out one distortion as a simulated ``unknown'' distortion for the meta-testing phase. Through meta-learning, the model is encouraged to identify and utilize neurons that exhibit stable activations across different types of distortions, mitigating the optimization conflicts caused by the random sampling of diverse distortions in each batch. To further promote the transformation of stable activations into distortion-invariant representations, we introduce a feature consistency loss that constrains the decoded features of the same image subjected to different distortions to remain consistent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to the SRD training strategy, Meta-FC improves the robustness and generalization of various watermarking models by an average of 1.59\%, 4.71\%, and 2.38\% under high-intensity, combined, and unknown distortions.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.21855
**Authors:** Lokesha Rasanjalee, Jin Lin Tan, Dileepa Pitawela, Rajvinder Singh, Hsiang-Ting Chen

**Abstract:**  Accurate annotation of endoscopic videos is essential yet time-consuming, particularly for challenging datasets such as dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus, where the affected regions are irregular and lack clear boundaries. Semi-automatic tools like Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can ease this process by propagating annotations across frames, but small errors often accumulate and reduce accuracy, requiring expert review and correction. To address this, we systematically study how annotation errors propagate across different prompt types, namely masks, boxes, and points, and propose Learning-to-Re-Prompt (L2RP), a cost-aware framework that learns when and where to seek expert input. By tuning a human-cost parameter, our method balances annotation effort and segmentation accuracy. Experiments on a private Barrett's dysplasia dataset and the public SUN-SEG benchmark demonstrate improved temporal consistency and superior performance over baseline strategies.

**Comment:** Presents a method for adaptive expert intervention in video segmentation annotation, with a focus on error propagation and cost-aware prompting. While it is a methodological improvement in annotation, it is not directly about spatial intelligence, VLLMs, or embodied AI. Not a direct match to any criterion.

## 44. [Semantic Partial Grounding via LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22067) <a id="link44"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.22067
**Authors:** Giuseppe Canonaco, Alberto Pozanco, Daniel Borrajo

**Abstract:**  Grounding is a critical step in classical planning, yet it often becomes a computational bottleneck due to the exponential growth in grounded actions and atoms as task size increases. Recent advances in partial grounding have addressed this challenge by incrementally grounding only the most promising operators, guided by predictive models. However, these approaches primarily rely on relational features or learned embeddings and do not leverage the textual and structural cues present in PDDL descriptions. We propose SPG-LLM, which uses LLMs to analyze the domain and problem files to heuristically identify potentially irrelevant objects, actions, and predicates prior to grounding, significantly reducing the size of the grounded task. Across seven hard-to-ground benchmarks, SPG-LLM achieves faster grounding-often by orders of magnitude-while delivering comparable or better plan costs in some domains.

**Comment:** Somewhat relevant to spatial intelligence and LLMs, but focuses on classical planning and grounding, not directly on embodied agents or vision foundation models.
