## 0. [UniMo: Unifying 2D Video and 3D Human Motion with an Autoregressive Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03918) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03918
**Authors:** Youxin Pang, Yong Zhang, Ruizhi Shao, Xiang Deng, Feng Gao, Xu Xiaoming, Xiaoming Wei, Yebin Liu

**Abstract:**  We propose UniMo, an innovative autoregressive model for joint modeling of 2D human videos and 3D human motions within a unified framework, enabling simultaneous generation and understanding of these two modalities for the first time. Current methods predominantly focus on generating one modality given another as the condition or integrating either of them with other modalities such as text and audio. Unifying 2D videos and 3D motions for simultaneous optimization and generation remains largely unexplored, presenting significant challenges due to their substantial structural and distributional differences. Inspired by the LLM's ability to unify different modalities, our method models videos and 3D motions as a unified tokens sequence, utilizing separate embedding layers to mitigate distribution gaps. Additionally, we devise a sequence modeling strategy that integrates two distinct tasks within a single framework, proving the effectiveness of unified modeling. Moreover, to efficiently align with visual tokens and preserve 3D spatial information, we design a novel 3D motion tokenizer with a temporal expansion strategy, using a single VQ-VAE to produce quantized motion tokens. It features multiple expert decoders that handle body shapes, translation, global orientation, and body poses for reliable 3D motion reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method simultaneously generates corresponding videos and motions while performing accurate motion capture. This work taps into the capacity of LLMs to fuse diverse data types, paving the way for integrating human-centric information into existing models and potentially enabling multimodal, controllable joint modeling of humans, objects, and scenes.

**Comment:** Closely matches criterion 2 (shows new MLLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Proposes a unified autoregressive framework for 2D video and 3D human motion, leveraging LLM-style modeling for multi-modal learning.

## 1. [C3G: Learning Compact 3D Representations with 2K Gaussians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04021) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.04021
**Authors:** Honggyu An, Jaewoo Jung, Mungyeom Kim, Sunghwan Hong, Chaehyun Kim, Kazumi Fukuda, Minkyeong Jeon, Jisang Han, Takuya Narihira, Hyuna Ko, Junsu Kim, Yuki Mitsufuji, Seungryong Kim

**Abstract:**  Reconstructing and understanding 3D scenes from unposed sparse views in a feed-forward manner remains as a challenging task in 3D computer vision. Recent approaches use per-pixel 3D Gaussian Splatting for reconstruction, followed by a 2D-to-3D feature lifting stage for scene understanding. However, they generate excessive redundant Gaussians, causing high memory overhead and sub-optimal multi-view feature aggregation, leading to degraded novel view synthesis and scene understanding performance. We propose C3G, a novel feed-forward framework that estimates compact 3D Gaussians only at essential spatial locations, minimizing redundancy while enabling effective feature lifting. We introduce learnable tokens that aggregate multi-view features through self-attention to guide Gaussian generation, ensuring each Gaussian integrates relevant visual features across views. We then exploit the learned attention patterns for Gaussian decoding to efficiently lift features. Extensive experiments on pose-free novel view synthesis, 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, and view-invariant feature aggregation demonstrate our approach's effectiveness. Results show that a compact yet geometrically meaningful representation is sufficient for high-quality scene reconstruction and understanding, achieving superior memory efficiency and feature fidelity compared to existing methods.

**Comment:** Closely matches criterion 1 (new methodological improvements to spatial understanding on embodied agents) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Proposes a compact 3D representation for scene understanding and novel view synthesis, with strong spatial intelligence and efficient feature aggregation.

## 2. [SpaceTools: Tool-Augmented Spatial Reasoning via Double Interactive RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04069) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.04069
**Authors:** Siyi Chen, Mikaela Angelina Uy, Chan Hee Song, Faisal Ladhak, Adithyavairavan Murali, Qing Qu, Stan Birchfield, Valts Blukis, Jonathan Tremblay

**Abstract:**  Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong qualitative visual understanding, but struggle with metrically precise spatial reasoning required for embodied applications. The agentic paradigm promises that VLMs can use a wide variety of tools that could augment these capabilities, such as depth estimators, segmentation models, and pose estimators. Yet it remains an open challenge how to realize this vision without solely relying on handcrafted prompting strategies or enforcing fixed, predefined tool pipelines that limit VLMs' ability to discover optimal tool-use patterns. Reinforcement Learning could overcome this gap, but has so far been limited to reasoning with a single visual tool due to the large search space in multi-tool reasoning. We introduce Double Interactive Reinforcement Learning (DIRL), a two-phase training framework where VLMs learn to coordinate multiple tools through interactive exploration and feedback. In the teaching phase, we combine demonstrations from a single tool specialist trained via interactive RL with traces from a frontier model using all tools. In the exploration phase, the model further refines multi-tool coordination through continued RL. Our model, SpaceTools, with tool-augmented spatial reasoning ability, achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial understanding benchmarks (RoboSpatial-Home, BLINK, BOP-ASK) and demonstrates reliable real-world manipulation using a 7-DOF robot as a tool. DIRL provides substantial improvements over the vanilla SFT (+12% on RoboSpatial) and RL (+16% on RoboSpatial) baselines. Project page: https://spacetools.github.io/.

**Comment:** Strongly matches criterion 1 (new methodological improvements to spatial understanding on embodied agents) and criterion 3 (novel embodied AI method for spatial reasoning with tool use). Introduces a new RL framework (DIRL) for tool-augmented spatial reasoning in VLMs, with strong empirical results on spatial understanding benchmarks.

## 3. [TempR1: Improving Temporal Understanding of MLLMs via Temporal-Aware Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03963) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03963
**Authors:** Tao Wu, Li Yang, Gen Zhan, Yiting Liao, Junlin Li, Deliang Fu, Li Zhang, Limin Wang

**Abstract:**  Enhancing the temporal understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for advancing long-form video analysis, enabling tasks such as temporal localization, action detection, and time-sensitive question answering. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been explored for improving temporal reasoning, existing approaches are often confined to limited task types and data, restricting their generalization across diverse temporal understanding scenarios. To address this challenge, we present TempR1, a temporal-aware multi-task reinforcement learning framework that systematically strengthens MLLMs' temporal comprehension. We curate a multi-task corpus that exposes the model to diverse temporal structures and semantics, and build upon the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to achieve stable and effective cross-task optimization. Specifically, we categorize temporal tasks into three correspondence types between predicted intervals and ground-truth instances, and design tailored localization rewards for each, enabling TempR1 to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies and adapt to different temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TempR1 attains state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, its joint optimization over complementary tasks yields a strong synergistic effect, enhancing both generalization and single-task performance, establishing a scalable and principled paradigm for temporal reasoning in MLLMs.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new MLLM with temporal reasoning improvements) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and their application to temporal video understanding). Introduces a new multi-task RL framework for temporal understanding in MLLMs, with new reward design and empirical results.

## 4. [CSMapping: Scalable Crowdsourced Semantic Mapping and Topology Inference for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03510) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03510
**Authors:** Zhijian Qiao, Zehuan Yu, Tong Li, Chih-Chung Chou, Wenchao Ding, Shaojie Shen

**Abstract:**  Crowdsourcing enables scalable autonomous driving map construction, but low-cost sensor noise hinders quality from improving with data volume. We propose CSMapping, a system that produces accurate semantic maps and topological road centerlines whose quality consistently increases with more crowdsourced data. For semantic mapping, we train a latent diffusion model on HD maps (optionally conditioned on SD maps) to learn a generative prior of real-world map structure, without requiring paired crowdsourced/HD-map supervision. This prior is incorporated via constrained MAP optimization in latent space, ensuring robustness to severe noise and plausible completion in unobserved areas. Initialization uses a robust vectorized mapping module followed by diffusion inversion; optimization employs efficient Gaussian-basis reparameterization, projected gradient descent zobracket multi-start, and latent-space factor-graph for global consistency. For topological mapping, we apply confidence-weighted k-medoids clustering and kinematic refinement to trajectories, yielding smooth, human-like centerlines robust to trajectory variation. Experiments on nuScenes, Argoverse 2, and a large proprietary dataset achieve state-of-the-art semantic and topological mapping performance, with thorough ablation and scalability studies.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (new methodological improvements to spatial understanding for embodied agents) and criterion 3 (novel mapping method and robust generative/statistical tricks for semantic and topological mapping, with new empirical results and ablation studies). Uses diffusion models and clever optimization for robust semantic mapping from noisy crowdsourced data, which is a novel angle.

## 5. [GeoVideo: Introducing Geometric Regularization into Video Generation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03453) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03453
**Authors:** Yunpeng Bai, Shaoheng Fang, Chaohui Yu, Fan Wang, Qixing Huang

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in video generation have enabled the synthesis of high-quality and visually realistic clips using diffusion transformer models. However, most existing approaches operate purely in the 2D pixel space and lack explicit mechanisms for modeling 3D structures, often resulting in temporally inconsistent geometries, implausible motions, and structural artifacts. In this work, we introduce geometric regularization losses into video generation by augmenting latent diffusion models with per-frame depth prediction. We adopted depth as the geometric representation because of the great progress in depth prediction and its compatibility with image-based latent encoders. Specifically, to enforce structural consistency over time, we propose a multi-view geometric loss that aligns the predicted depth maps across frames within a shared 3D coordinate system. Our method bridges the gap between appearance generation and 3D structure modeling, leading to improved spatio-temporal coherence, shape consistency, and physical plausibility. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our approach produces significantly more stable and geometrically consistent results than existing baselines.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4: introduces geometric regularization into video generation models, bridging 2D appearance and 3D structure for improved spatio-temporal coherence, a novel application of vision foundation models.

## 6. [FireSentry: A Multi-Modal Spatio-temporal Benchmark Dataset for Fine-Grained Wildfire Spread Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03369) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03369
**Authors:** Nan Zhou, Huandong Wang, Jiahao Li, Han Li, Yali Song, Qiuhua Wang, Yong Li, Xinlei Chen

**Abstract:**  Fine-grained wildfire spread prediction is crucial for enhancing emergency response efficacy and decision-making precision. However, existing research predominantly focuses on coarse spatiotemporal scales and relies on low-resolution satellite data, capturing only macroscopic fire states while fundamentally constraining high-precision localized fire dynamics modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we present FireSentry, a provincial-scale multi-modal wildfire dataset characterized by sub-meter spatial and sub-second temporal resolution. Collected using synchronized UAV platforms, FireSentry provides visible and infrared video streams, in-situ environmental measurements, and manually validated fire masks. Building on FireSentry, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing physics-based, data-driven, and generative models, revealing the limitations of existing mask-only approaches. Our analysis proposes FiReDiff, a novel dual-modality paradigm that first predicts future video sequences in the infrared modality, and then precisely segments fire masks in the mask modality based on the generated dynamics. FiReDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, with video quality gains of 39.2% in PSNR, 36.1% in SSIM, 50.0% in LPIPS, 29.4% in FVD, and mask accuracy gains of 3.3% in AUPRC, 59.1% in F1 score, 42.9% in IoU, and 62.5% in MSE when applied to generative models. The FireSentry benchmark dataset and FiReDiff paradigm collectively advance fine-grained wildfire forecasting and dynamic disaster simulation. The processed benchmark dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/Munan222/FireSentry-Benchmark-Dataset.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3: introduces a new multi-modal, high-resolution benchmark dataset (FireSentry) for fine-grained wildfire spread forecasting, with a novel dual-modality paradigm (FiReDiff) and comprehensive benchmarking. Also relevant to criterion 4 due to generative modeling and multi-modal data.

## 7. [PosA-VLA: Enhancing Action Generation via Pose-Conditioned Anchor Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03724) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03724
**Authors:** Ziwen Li, Xin Wang, Hanlue Zhang, Runnan Chen, Runqi Lin, Xiao He, Han Huang, Yandong Guo, Fakhri Karray, Tongliang Liu, Mingming Gong

**Abstract:**  The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable performance on embodied tasks and shown promising potential for real-world applications. However, current VLAs still struggle to produce consistent and precise target-oriented actions, as they often generate redundant or unstable motions along trajectories, limiting their applicability in time-sensitive scenarios.In this work, we attribute these redundant actions to the spatially uniform perception field of existing VLAs, which causes them to be distracted by target-irrelevant objects, especially in complex environments.To address this issue, we propose an efficient PosA-VLA framework that anchors visual attention via pose-conditioned supervision, consistently guiding the model's perception toward task-relevant regions. The pose-conditioned anchor attention mechanism enables the model to better align instruction semantics with actionable visual cues, thereby improving action generation precision and efficiency. Moreover, our framework adopts a lightweight architecture and requires no auxiliary perception modules (e.g., segmentation or grounding networks), ensuring efficient inference. Extensive experiments verify that our method executes embodied tasks with precise and time-efficient behavior across diverse robotic manipulation benchmarks and shows robust generalization in a variety of challenging environments.

**Comment:** Closely matches criterion 1 (new methodological improvements to spatial understanding on embodied agents) and criterion 3 (embodied AI papers with new methods). Proposes a pose-conditioned anchor attention mechanism for more precise action generation in embodied tasks, addressing spatial perception in VLA models.

## 8. [Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced Medical Vision-Language Pretraining with Multi-Agent Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03445) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03445
**Authors:** Xieji Li, Siyuan Yan, Yingsheng Liu, H. Peter Soyer, Monika Janda, Victoria Mar, Zongyuan Ge

**Abstract:**  Vision-language pretraining (VLP) has emerged as a powerful paradigm in medical image analysis, enabling representation learning from large-scale image-text pairs without relying on expensive manual annotations. However, existing methods often struggle with the noise inherent in web-collected data and the complexity of unstructured long medical texts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel VLP framework integrating a Multi-Agent data GENeration (MAGEN) system and Ontology-based Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced (O-MAKE) pretraining. First, MAGEN enhances data quality by synthesizing knowledge-enriched descriptions via a foundation model-assisted captioning and retrieval-based verification pipeline. Second, O-MAKE addresses the difficulty of learning from long, unstructured texts by decomposing them into distinct knowledge aspects. This facilitates fine-grained alignment at both global and patch levels, while explicitly modeling medical concept relationships through ontology-guided mechanisms. We validate our framework in the field of dermatology, where comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on disease classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks across eight datasets. Our code and the augmented dataset Derm1M-AgentAug, comprising over 400k skin-image-text pairs, will be released at https://github.com/SiyuanYan1/Derm1M.

**Comment:** Closely matches criterion 2 (shows new VLLMs/MLLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Proposes a new medical vision-language pretraining framework with multi-agent data generation and ontology-based knowledge enhancement.

## 9. [RELIC: Interactive Video World Model with Long-Horizon Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04040) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.04040
**Authors:** Yicong Hong, Yiqun Mei, Chongjian Ge, Yiran Xu, Yang Zhou, Sai Bi, Yannick Hold-Geoffroy, Mike Roberts, Matthew Fisher, Eli Shechtman, Kalyan Sunkavalli, Feng Liu, Zhengqi Li, Hao Tan

**Abstract:**  A truly interactive world model requires three key ingredients: real-time long-horizon streaming, consistent spatial memory, and precise user control. However, most existing approaches address only one of these aspects in isolation, as achieving all three simultaneously is highly challenging-for example, long-term memory mechanisms often degrade real-time performance. In this work, we present RELIC, a unified framework that tackles these three challenges altogether. Given a single image and a text description, RELIC enables memory-aware, long-duration exploration of arbitrary scenes in real time. Built upon recent autoregressive video-diffusion distillation techniques, our model represents long-horizon memory using highly compressed historical latent tokens encoded with both relative actions and absolute camera poses within the KV cache. This compact, camera-aware memory structure supports implicit 3D-consistent content retrieval and enforces long-term coherence with minimal computational overhead. In parallel, we fine-tune a bidirectional teacher video model to generate sequences beyond its original 5-second training horizon, and transform it into a causal student generator using a new memory-efficient self-forcing paradigm that enables full-context distillation over long-duration teacher as well as long student self-rollouts. Implemented as a 14B-parameter model and trained on a curated Unreal Engine-rendered dataset, RELIC achieves real-time generation at 16 FPS while demonstrating more accurate action following, more stable long-horizon streaming, and more robust spatial-memory retrieval compared with prior work. These capabilities establish RELIC as a strong foundation for the next generation of interactive world modeling.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (embodied AI, new benchmark/method for interactive world modeling) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). RELIC is a unified framework for interactive video world modeling with long-horizon memory, real-time streaming, and spatial memory, using video-diffusion distillation and compact memory structures.

## 10. [YOLOA: Real-Time Affordance Detection via LLM Adapter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03418) <a id="link10"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03418
**Authors:** Yuqi Ji, Junjie Ke, Lihuo He, Jun Liu, Kaifan Zhang, Yu-Kun Lai, Guiguang Ding, Xinbo Gao

**Abstract:**  Affordance detection aims to jointly address the fundamental "what-where-how" challenge in embodied AI by understanding "what" an object is, "where" the object is located, and "how" it can be used. However, most affordance learning methods focus solely on "how" objects can be used while neglecting the "what" and "where" aspects. Other affordance detection methods treat object detection and affordance learning as two independent tasks, lacking effective interaction and real-time capability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce YOLO Affordance (YOLOA), a real-time affordance detection model that jointly handles these two tasks via a large language model (LLM) adapter. Specifically, YOLOA employs a lightweight detector consisting of object detection and affordance learning branches refined through the LLM Adapter. During training, the LLM Adapter interacts with object and affordance preliminary predictions to refine both branches by generating more accurate class priors, box offsets, and affordance gates. Experiments on our relabeled ADG-Det and IIT-Heat benchmarks demonstrate that YOLOA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (52.8 / 73.1 mAP on ADG-Det / IIT-Heat) while maintaining real-time performance (up to 89.77 FPS, and up to 846.24 FPS for the lightweight variant). This indicates that YOLOA achieves an excellent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 and 3. Proposes YOLOA, a real-time affordance detection model for embodied AI, using an LLM adapter to jointly address 'what-where-how' in affordance detection. This is a novel method for spatial understanding and embodied AI, with a new angle on affordance learning.

## 11. [Step-by-step Layered Design Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03335) <a id="link11"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03335
**Authors:** Faizan Farooq Khan, K J Joseph, Koustava Goswami, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Balaji Vasan Srinivasan

**Abstract:**  Design generation, in its essence, is a step-by-step process where designers progressively refine and enhance their work through careful modifications. Despite this fundamental characteristic, existing approaches mainly treat design synthesis as a single-step generation problem, significantly underestimating the inherent complexity of the creative process. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel problem setting called Step-by-Step Layered Design Generation, which tasks a machine learning model with generating a design that adheres to a sequence of instructions from a designer. Leveraging recent advancements in multi-modal LLMs, we propose SLEDGE: Step-by-step LayEred Design GEnerator to model each update to a design as an atomic, layered change over its previous state, while being grounded in the instruction. To complement our new problem setting, we introduce a new evaluation suite, including a dataset and a benchmark. Our exhaustive experimental analysis and comparison with state-of-the-art approaches tailored to our new setup demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. We hope our work will attract attention to this pragmatic and under-explored research area.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2: leverages multi-modal LLMs for step-by-step layered design generation, introduces a new problem setting, model (SLEDGE), and benchmark, focusing on multi-modal generative modeling.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03939
**Authors:** Guole Shen, Tianchen Deng, Xingrui Qin, Nailin Wang, Jianyu Wang, Yanbo Wang, Yongtao Chen, Hesheng Wang, Jingchuan Wang

**Abstract:**  Recent stateful recurrent neural networks have achieved remarkable progress on static 3D reconstruction but remain vulnerable to motion-induced artifacts, where non-rigid regions corrupt attention propagation between the spatial memory and image feature. By analyzing the internal behaviors of the state and image token updating mechanism, we find that aggregating self-attention maps across layers reveals a consistent pattern: dynamic regions are naturally down-weighted, exposing an implicit motion cue that the pretrained transformer already encodes but never explicitly uses. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MUT3R, a training-free framework that applies the attention-derived motion cue to suppress dynamic content in the early layers of the transformer during inference. Our attention-level gating module suppresses the influence of dynamic regions before their artifacts propagate through the feature hierarchy. Notably, we do not retrain or fine-tune the model; we let the pretrained transformer diagnose its own motion cues and correct itself. This early regulation stabilizes geometric reasoning in streaming scenarios and leads to improvements in temporal consistency and camera pose robustness across multiple dynamic benchmarks, offering a simple and training-free pathway toward motion-aware streaming reconstruction.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (spatial intelligence in embodied agents) and criterion 3 (novel method for dynamic 3D reconstruction in streaming scenarios). Proposes a training-free, motion-aware transformer for dynamic 3D reconstruction, with empirical insights into attention-derived motion cues.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03499
**Authors:** Renqi Chen, Haoyang Su, Shixiang Tang

**Abstract:**  The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has emerged as a powerful visual foundation model for image segmentation. However, adapting SAM to specific downstream tasks, such as medical and agricultural imaging, remains a significant challenge. To address this, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have been widely employed to enhancing SAM's adaptation performance on diverse domains. Despite advancements, a critical question arises: can we integrate inductive bias into the model? This is particularly relevant since the Transformer encoder in SAM inherently lacks spatial priors within image patches, potentially hindering the acquisition of high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose NAS-LoRA, a new Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method designed to bridge the semantic gap between pre-trained SAM and specialized domains. Specifically, NAS-LoRA incorporates a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) block between the encoder and decoder components of LoRA to dynamically optimize the prior knowledge integrated into weight updates. Furthermore, we propose a stage-wise optimization strategy to help the ViT encoder balance weight updates and architectural adjustments, facilitating the gradual learning of high-level semantic information. Various Experiments demonstrate our NAS-LoRA improves existing PEFT methods, while reducing training cost by 24.14% without increasing inference cost, highlighting the potential of NAS in enhancing PEFT for visual foundation models.

**Comment:** Strongly matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Proposes a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning method (NAS-LoRA) for adapting the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to new domains, with architectural search and improved efficiency.

**Authors:** Tengda Han, Sayna Ebrahimi, Dilara Gokay, Li Yang Ku, Maks Ovsjanikov, Iva Babukova, Daniel Zoran, Viorica Patraucean, Joao Carreira, Andrew Zisserman, Dima Damen

**Abstract:**  We introduce the "single-life" learning paradigm, where we train a distinct vision model exclusively on egocentric videos captured by one individual. We leverage the multiple viewpoints naturally captured within a single life to learn a visual encoder in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate three key findings. First, models trained independently on different lives develop a highly aligned geometric understanding. We demonstrate this by training visual encoders on distinct datasets each capturing a different life, both indoors and outdoors, as well as introducing a novel cross-attention-based metric to quantify the functional alignment of the internal representations developed by different models. Second, we show that single-life models learn generalizable geometric representations that effectively transfer to downstream tasks, such as depth estimation, in unseen environments. Third, we demonstrate that training on up to 30 hours from one week of the same person's life leads to comparable performance to training on 30 hours of diverse web data, highlighting the strength of single-life representation learning. Overall, our results establish that the shared structure of the world, both leads to consistency in models trained on individual lives, and provides a powerful signal for visual representation learning.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03370
**Authors:** Lingjun Zhao, Yandong Luo, James Hay, Lu Gan

**Abstract:**  We introduce ShelfGaussian, an open-vocabulary multi-modal Gaussian-based 3D scene understanding framework supervised by off-the-shelf vision foundation models (VFMs). Gaussian-based methods have demonstrated superior performance and computational efficiency across a wide range of scene understanding tasks. However, existing methods either model objects as closed-set semantic Gaussians supervised by annotated 3D labels, neglecting their rendering ability, or learn open-set Gaussian representations via purely 2D self-supervision, leading to degraded geometry and limited to camera-only settings. To fully exploit the potential of Gaussians, we propose a Multi-Modal Gaussian Transformer that enables Gaussians to query features from diverse sensor modalities, and a Shelf-Supervised Learning Paradigm that efficiently optimizes Gaussians with VFM features jointly at 2D image and 3D scene levels. We evaluate ShelfGaussian on various perception and planning tasks. Experiments on Occ3D-nuScenes demonstrate its state-of-the-art zero-shot semantic occupancy prediction performance. ShelfGaussian is further evaluated on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to assess its in the-wild performance across diverse urban scenarios.

**Authors:** Jiazhe Wei, Ken Li, Tianyu Lao, Haofan Wang, Liang Wang, Caifeng Shan, Chenyang Si

**Abstract:**  Graphic design forms the cornerstone of modern visual communication, serving as a vital medium for promoting cultural and commercial events. Recent advances have explored automating this process using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), yet existing methods often produce geometrically inaccurate layouts and lack the iterative, layer-specific editing required in professional workflows. To address these limitations, we present PosterCopilot, a framework that advances layout reasoning and controllable editing for professional graphic design. Specifically, we introduce a progressive three-stage training strategy that equips LMMs with geometric understanding and aesthetic reasoning for layout design, consisting of Perturbed Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning for Visual-Reality Alignment, and Reinforcement Learning from Aesthetic Feedback. Furthermore, we develop a complete workflow that couples the trained LMM-based design model with generative models, enabling layer-controllable, iterative editing for precise element refinement while maintaining global visual consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PosterCopilot achieves geometrically accurate and aesthetically superior layouts, offering unprecedented controllability for professional iterative design.

**Authors:** Yuxiang He, Jian Zhao, Yuchen Yuan, Tianle Zhang, Wei Cai, Haojie Cheng, Ziyan Shi, Ming Zhu, Haichuan Tang, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li

**Abstract:**  The exponential growth of digital content presents significant challenges for content safety. Current moderation systems, often based on single models or fixed pipelines, exhibit limitations in identifying implicit risks and providing interpretable judgment processes. To address these issues, we propose Aetheria, a multimodal interpretable content safety framework based on multi-agent debate and collaboration.Employing a collaborative architecture of five core agents, Aetheria conducts in-depth analysis and adjudication of multimodal content through a dynamic, mutually persuasive debate mechanism, which is grounded by RAG-based knowledge retrieval.Comprehensive experiments on our proposed benchmark (AIR-Bench) validate that Aetheria not only generates detailed and traceable audit reports but also demonstrates significant advantages over baselines in overall content safety accuracy, especially in the identification of implicit risks. This framework establishes a transparent and interpretable paradigm, significantly advancing the field of trustworthy AI content moderation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.04000
**Authors:** Jialuo Li, Bin Li, Jiahao Li, Yan Lu

**Abstract:**  The application of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to long-form video understanding is constrained by limited context lengths and the computationally prohibitive cost of processing dense video tokens. Consequently, recent research has focused on query-aware frame selection, methods that often incur significant computational overhead. This paper challenges the assumption that such complex search mechanisms are universally necessary. We first identify and validate a query typology distinguishing between global query and localized query. We demonstrate that while uniform sampling is both effective and efficient for global queries, localized queries indeed necessitate query-aware selection for optimal performance. Building on this insight, we propose DIG, a training-free frame selection framework that adapts its strategy based on the query type. Specifically,DIG employs efficient uniform sampling for global queries while activating a specialized pipeline to extract query-relevant frames for localized queries. Experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that DIG consistently outperforms existing baselines and robustly improves LMM performance, even when scaling the input frame count to 256.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03905
**Authors:** Shuai Yang, Junxin Lin, Yifan Zhou, Ziwei Liu, Chen Change Loy

**Abstract:**  The remarkable success in text-to-image diffusion models has motivated extensive investigation of their potential for video applications. Zero-shot techniques aim to adapt image diffusion models for videos without requiring further model training. Recent methods largely emphasize integrating inter-frame correspondence into attention mechanisms. However, the soft constraint applied to identify the valid features to attend is insufficient, which could lead to temporal inconsistency. In this paper, we present FRESCO, which integrates intra-frame correspondence with inter-frame correspondence to formulate a more robust spatial-temporal constraint. This enhancement ensures a consistent transformation of semantically similar content between frames. Our method goes beyond attention guidance to explicitly optimize features, achieving high spatial-temporal consistency with the input video, significantly enhancing the visual coherence of manipulated videos. We verify FRESCO adaptations on two zero-shot tasks of video-to-video translation and text-guided video editing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating high-quality, coherent videos, highlighting a significant advance over current zero-shot methods.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4: proposes FRESCO, a new method for zero-shot video translation and editing with improved spatial-temporal consistency, building on advances in diffusion models for vision applications.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03979
**Authors:** Jin-Ting He, Fu-Jen Tsai, Yan-Tsung Peng, Min-Hung Chen, Chia-Wen Lin, Yen-Yu Lin

**Abstract:**  Diffusion models show promise for dynamic scene deblurring; however, existing studies often fail to leverage the intrinsic nature of the blurring process within diffusion models, limiting their full potential. To address it, we present a Blur Diffusion Model (BlurDM), which seamlessly integrates the blur formation process into diffusion for image deblurring. Observing that motion blur stems from continuous exposure, BlurDM implicitly models the blur formation process through a dual-diffusion forward scheme, diffusing both noise and blur onto a sharp image. During the reverse generation process, we derive a dual denoising and deblurring formulation, enabling BlurDM to recover the sharp image by simultaneously denoising and deblurring, given pure Gaussian noise conditioned on the blurred image as input. Additionally, to efficiently integrate BlurDM into deblurring networks, we perform BlurDM in the latent space, forming a flexible prior generation network for deblurring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BlurDM significantly and consistently enhances existing deblurring methods on four benchmark datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/Jin-Ting-He/BlurDM.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03540
**Authors:** Ruoxuan Zhang, Bin Wen, Hongxia Xie, Yi Yao, Songhan Zuo, Jian-Yu Jiang-Lin, Hong-Han Shuai, Wen-Huang Cheng

**Abstract:**  Cooking is a sequential and visually grounded activity, where each step such as chopping, mixing, or frying carries both procedural logic and visual semantics. While recent diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in text-to-image generation, they struggle to handle structured multi-step scenarios like recipe illustration. Additionally, current recipe illustration methods are unable to adjust to the natural variability in recipe length, generating a fixed number of images regardless of the actual instructions structure. To address these limitations, we present CookAnything, a flexible and consistent diffusion-based framework that generates coherent, semantically distinct image sequences from textual cooking instructions of arbitrary length. The framework introduces three key components: (1) Step-wise Regional Control (SRC), which aligns textual steps with corresponding image regions within a single denoising process; (2) Flexible RoPE, a step-aware positional encoding mechanism that enhances both temporal coherence and spatial diversity; and (3) Cross-Step Consistency Control (CSCC), which maintains fine-grained ingredient consistency across steps. Experimental results on recipe illustration benchmarks show that CookAnything performs better than existing methods in training-based and training-free settings. The proposed framework supports scalable, high-quality visual synthesis of complex multi-step instructions and holds significant potential for broad applications in instructional media, and procedural content creation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03500
**Authors:** Te Yang, Xiangyu Zhu, Bo Wang, Quan Chen, Peng Jiang, Zhen Lei

**Abstract:**  Long-form video understanding requires efficient navigation of extensive visual data to pinpoint sparse yet critical information. Current approaches to longform video understanding either suffer from severe computational overhead due to dense preprocessing, or fail to effectively balance exploration and exploitation, resulting in incomplete information coverage and inefficiency. In this work, we introduce EEA, a novel video agent framework that archives exploration-exploitation balance through semantic guidance with hierarchical tree search process. EEA autonomously discovers and dynamically updates task-relevant semantic queries, and collects video frames closely matched to these queries as semantic anchors. During the tree search process, instead of uniform expansion, EEA preferentially explores semantically relevant frames while ensuring sufficient coverage within unknown segments. Moreover, EEA adaptively combines intrinsic rewards from visionlanguage models (VLMs) with semantic priors by explicitly modeling uncertainty to achieve stable and precise evaluation of video segments. Experiments across various long-video benchmarks validate the superior performance and computational efficiency of our proposed method.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (embodied AI, new methods for spatial/temporal understanding in long video). Introduces a novel agent framework (EEA) for long video understanding using semantic guidance and hierarchical tree search, with explicit use of vision-language models for intrinsic rewards.

**Authors:** Muhammed Burak Kizil, Enes Sanli, Niloy J. Mitra, Erkut Erdem, Aykut Erdem, Duygu Ceylan

**Abstract:**  Video generation has achieved remarkable progress in visual fidelity and controllability, enabling conditioning on text, layout, or motion. Among these, motion control - specifying object dynamics and camera trajectories - is essential for composing complex, cinematic scenes, yet existing interfaces remain limited. We introduce LAMP that leverages large language models (LLMs) as motion planners to translate natural language descriptions into explicit 3D trajectories for dynamic objects and (relatively defined) cameras. LAMP defines a motion domain-specific language (DSL), inspired by cinematography conventions. By harnessing program synthesis capabilities of LLMs, LAMP generates structured motion programs from natural language, which are deterministically mapped to 3D trajectories. We construct a large-scale procedural dataset pairing natural text descriptions with corresponding motion programs and 3D trajectories. Experiments demonstrate LAMP's improved performance in motion controllability and alignment with user intent compared to state-of-the-art alternatives establishing the first framework for generating both object and camera motions directly from natural language specifications.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new VLLMs/MLLMs) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). LAMP leverages LLMs for motion planning in controllable video generation, translating natural language to 3D trajectories, which is a novel multi-modal generative modeling approach.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.02193
**Authors:** Alexander Boyd, Franz Nowak, David Hyland, Manuel Baltieri, Fernando E. Rosas

**Abstract:**  World models have been recently proposed as sandbox environments in which AI agents can be trained and evaluated before deployment. Although realistic world models often have high computational demands, efficient modelling is usually possible by exploiting the fact that real-world scenarios tend to involve subcomponents that interact in a modular manner. In this paper, we explore this idea by developing a framework for decomposing complex world models represented by transducers, a class of models generalising POMDPs. Whereas the composition of transducers is well understood, our results clarify how to invert this process, deriving sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces, enabling parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modelling that can support distributed inference. Overall, these results lay a groundwork for bridging the structural transparency demanded by AI safety and the computational efficiency required for real-world inference.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03981
**Authors:** Sheng-Hao Liao, Shang-Fu Chen, Tai-Ming Huang, Wen-Huang Cheng, Kai-Lung Hua

**Abstract:**  Drag-based image editing using generative models provides intuitive control over image structures. However, existing methods rely heavily on manually provided masks and textual prompts to preserve semantic fidelity and motion precision. Removing these constraints creates a fundamental trade-off: visual artifacts without masks and poor spatial control without prompts. To address these limitations, we propose DirectDrag, a novel mask- and prompt-free editing framework. DirectDrag enables precise and efficient manipulation with minimal user input while maintaining high image fidelity and accurate point alignment. DirectDrag introduces two key innovations. First, we design an Auto Soft Mask Generation module that intelligently infers editable regions from point displacement, automatically localizing deformation along movement paths while preserving contextual integrity through the generative model's inherent capacity. Second, we develop a Readout-Guided Feature Alignment mechanism that leverages intermediate diffusion activations to maintain structural consistency during point-based edits, substantially improving visual fidelity. Despite operating without manual mask or prompt, DirectDrag achieves superior image quality compared to existing methods while maintaining competitive drag accuracy. Extensive experiments on DragBench and real-world scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of DirectDrag for high-quality, interactive image manipulation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03590
**Authors:** Yuchen Deng, Xiuyang Wu, Hai-Tao Zheng, Jie Wang, Feidiao Yang, Yuxing Han

**Abstract:**  Handling fast, complex, and highly non-linear motion patterns has long posed challenges for video frame interpolation. Although recent diffusion-based approaches improve upon traditional optical-flow-based methods, they still struggle to cover diverse application scenarios and often fail to produce sharp, temporally consistent frames in fine-grained motion tasks such as audio-visual synchronized interpolation. To address these limitations, we introduce BBF (Beyond Boundary Frames), a context-aware video frame interpolation framework, which could be guided by audio/visual semantics. First, we enhance the input design of the interpolation model so that it can flexibly handle multiple conditional modalities, including text, audio, images, and video. Second, we propose a decoupled multimodal fusion mechanism that sequentially injects different conditional signals into a DiT backbone. Finally, to maintain the generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt a progressive multi-stage training paradigm, where the start-end frame difference embedding is used to dynamically adjust both the data sampling and the loss weighting. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BBF outperforms specialized state-of-the-art methods on both generic interpolation and audio-visual synchronized interpolation tasks, establishing a unified framework for video frame interpolation under coordinated multi-channel conditioning.

**Authors:** Jisang Han, Sunghwan Hong, Jaewoo Jung, Wooseok Jang, Honggyu An, Qianqian Wang, Seungryong Kim, Chen Feng

**Abstract:**  Reliable 3D reconstruction from in-the-wild image collections is often hindered by "noisy" images-irrelevant inputs with little or no view overlap with others. While traditional Structure-from-Motion pipelines handle such cases through geometric verification and outlier rejection, feed-forward 3D reconstruction models lack these explicit mechanisms, leading to degraded performance under in-the-wild conditions. In this paper, we discover that the existing feed-forward reconstruction model, e.g., VGGT, despite lacking explicit outlier-rejection mechanisms or noise-aware training, can inherently distinguish distractor images. Through an in-depth analysis under varying proportions of synthetic distractors, we identify a specific layer that naturally exhibits outlier-suppressing behavior. Further probing reveals that this layer encodes discriminative internal representations that enable an effective noise-filtering capability, which we simply leverage to perform outlier-view rejection in feed-forward 3D reconstruction without any additional fine-tuning or supervision. Extensive experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild datasets demonstrate that this implicit filtering mechanism is consistent and generalizes well across diverse scenarios.

**Authors:** Yaokun Li, Shuaixian Wang, Mantang Guo, Jiehui Huang, Taojun Ding, Mu Hu, Kaixuan Wang, Shaojie Shen, Guang Tan

**Abstract:**  We propose ReCamDriving, a purely vision-based, camera-controlled novel-trajectory video generation framework. While repair-based methods fail to restore complex artifacts and LiDAR-based approaches rely on sparse and incomplete cues, ReCamDriving leverages dense and scene-complete 3DGS renderings for explicit geometric guidance, achieving precise camera-controllable generation. To mitigate overfitting to restoration behaviors when conditioned on 3DGS renderings, ReCamDriving adopts a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage uses camera poses for coarse control, while the second stage incorporates 3DGS renderings for fine-grained viewpoint and geometric guidance. Furthermore, we present a 3DGS-based cross-trajectory data curation strategy to eliminate the train-test gap in camera transformation patterns, enabling scalable multi-trajectory supervision from monocular videos. Based on this strategy, we construct the ParaDrive dataset, containing over 110K parallel-trajectory video pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCamDriving achieves state-of-the-art camera controllability and structural consistency.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03424
**Authors:** Bin Liu, Chunyang Wang, Xuelian Liu

**Abstract:**  State Space Models (SSMs) demonstrate significant potential for long-sequence modeling, but their reliance on input order conflicts with the irregular nature of point clouds. Existing approaches often rely on predefined serialization strategies, which cannot adjust based on diverse geometric structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{DM3D}, a deformable Mamba architecture for point cloud understanding. Specifically, DM3D introduces an offset-guided Gaussian sequencing mechanism that unifies local resampling and global reordering within a deformable scan. The Gaussian-based KNN Resampling (GKR) enhances structural awareness by adaptively reorganizing neighboring points, while the Gaussian-based Differentiable Reordering (GDR) enables end-to-end optimization of serialization order. Furthermore, a Tri-Path Frequency Fusion module enhances feature complementarity and reduces aliasing. Together, these components enable structure-adaptive serialization of point clouds. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that DM3D achieves state-of-the-art performance in classification, few-shot learning, and part segmentation, demonstrating that adaptive serialization effectively unlocks the potential of SSMs for point cloud understanding.

However, when addressing real-world degradations, model performance is limited by the quality of ground-truth images in datasets due to practical constraints in data acquisition. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that enhances existing ground truth images to provide higher-quality supervision for real-world restoration. Our framework generates perceptually enhanced ground truth images using super-resolution by incorporating adaptive frequency masks, which are learned by a conditional frequency mask generator. These masks guide the optimal fusion of frequency components from the original ground truth and its super-resolved variants, yielding enhanced ground truth images. This frequency-domain mixup preserves the semantic consistency of the original content while selectively enriching perceptual details, preventing hallucinated artifacts that could compromise fidelity. The enhanced ground truth images are used to train a lightweight output refinement network that can be seamlessly integrated with existing restoration models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the quality of restored images. We further validate the effectiveness of both supervision enhancement and output refinement through user studies. Code is available at https://github.com/dhryougit/Beyond-the-Ground-Truth.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). Proposes a new framework for enhanced supervision in image restoration using frequency-domain mixup and adaptive frequency masks, improving foundation model training.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.04048
**Authors:** Sen Fang, Yalin Feng, Hongbin Zhong, Yanxin Zhang, Dimitris N. Metaxas

**Abstract:**  Sign Language Production (SLP) is the process of converting the complex input text into a real video. Most previous works focused on the Text2Gloss, Gloss2Pose, Pose2Vid stages, and some concentrated on Prompt2Gloss and Text2Avatar stages. However, this field has made slow progress due to the inaccuracy of text conversion, pose generation, and the rendering of poses into real human videos in these stages, resulting in gradually accumulating errors. Therefore, in this paper, we streamline the traditional redundant structure, simplify and optimize the task objective, and design a new sign language generative model called Stable Signer. It redefines the SLP task as a hierarchical generation end-to-end task that only includes text understanding (Prompt2Gloss, Text2Gloss) and Pose2Vid, and executes text understanding through our proposed new Sign Language Understanding Linker called SLUL, and generates hand gestures through the named SLP-MoE hand gesture rendering expert block to end-to-end generate high-quality and multi-style sign language videos. SLUL is trained using the newly developed Semantic-Aware Gloss Masking Loss (SAGM Loss). Its performance has improved by 48.6% compared to the current SOTA generation methods.

**Comment:** Somewhat relevant to criterion 4: introduces a new hierarchical generative model for sign language video synthesis, with novel loss and architecture, but not directly about vision foundation models or their applications.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03247
**Authors:** Haitian Zheng, Yuan Yao, Yongsheng Yu, Yuqian Zhou, Jiebo Luo, Zhe Lin

**Abstract:**  Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have markedly advanced the quality of image inpainting and local editing. However, the inherent latent compression often introduces pixel-level inconsistencies, such as chromatic shifts, texture mismatches, and visible seams along editing boundaries. Existing remedies, including background-conditioned latent decoding and pixel-space harmonization, usually fail to fully eliminate these artifacts in practice and do not generalize well across different latent representations or tasks. We introduce PixPerfect, a pixel-level refinement framework that delivers seamless, high-fidelity local edits across diverse LDM architectures and tasks. PixPerfect leverages (i) a differentiable discriminative pixel space that amplifies and suppresses subtle color and texture discrepancies, (ii) a comprehensive artifact simulation pipeline that exposes the refiner to realistic local editing artifacts during training, and (iii) a direct pixel-space refinement scheme that ensures broad applicability across diverse latent representations and tasks. Extensive experiments on inpainting, object removal, and insertion benchmarks demonstrate that PixPerfect substantially enhances perceptual fidelity and downstream editing performance, establishing a new standard for robust and high-fidelity localized image editing.

**Comment:** Related to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) as it proposes a new pixel-level refinement framework for latent diffusion models, which are widely used as vision foundation models.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03451
**Authors:** Zhiye Song, Steve Dai, Ben Keller, Brucek Khailany

**Abstract:**  Diffusion models have revolutionized video generation, becoming essential tools in creative content generation and physical simulation. Transformer-based architectures (DiTs) and classifier-free guidance (CFG) are two cornerstones of this success, enabling strong prompt adherence and realistic video quality. Despite their versatility and superior performance, these models require intensive computation. Each video generation requires dozens of iterative steps, and CFG doubles the required compute. This inefficiency hinders broader adoption in downstream applications.   We introduce GalaxyDiT, a training-free method to accelerate video generation with guidance alignment and systematic proxy selection for reuse metrics. Through rank-order correlation analysis, our technique identifies the optimal proxy for each video model, across model families and parameter scales, thereby ensuring optimal computational reuse. We achieve $1.87\times$ and $2.37\times$ speedup on Wan2.1-1.3B and Wan2.1-14B with only 0.97% and 0.72% drops on the VBench-2.0 benchmark. At high speedup rates, our approach maintains superior fidelity to the base model, exceeding prior state-of-the-art approaches by 5 to 10 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).

**Comment:** Somewhat related to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) as it proposes a method to accelerate video diffusion transformers, which are a type of vision foundation model. However, the focus is on efficiency rather than new model architectures or applications.

## 34. [UniComp: Rethinking Video Compression Through Informational Uniqueness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03575) <a id="link34"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03575
**Authors:** Chao Yuan, Shimin Chen, Minliang Lin, Limeng Qiao, Guanglu Wan, Lin Ma

**Abstract:**  Distinct from attention-based compression methods, this paper presents an information uniqueness driven video compression framework, termed UniComp, which aims to maximize the information fidelity of video representations under constrained computational budgets. Starting from the information-theoretic perspective, we formulate the vision compression as an optimization problem that minimizes conditional entropy (reconstruction error) between retained and full tokens. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of information uniqueness to measure intrinsic redundancy among tokens to link with reconstruction error. Based on uniqueness, we design three modules-Frame Group Fusion, Token Allocation, and Spatial Dynamic Compression-that progressively perform semantic frame grouping, adaptive resource allocation, and fine-grained spatial compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniComp consistently outperforms existing compression methods in preserving essential visual tokens under limited computational budgets, highlighting the pivotal role of information uniqueness in token compression efficacy.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.04084
**Authors:** Qinyu Zhao, Guangting Zheng, Tao Yang, Rui Zhu, Xingjian Leng, Stephen Gould, Liang Zheng

**Abstract:**  Normalizing Flows (NFs) learn invertible mappings between the data and a Gaussian distribution. Prior works usually suffer from two limitations. First, they add random noise to training samples or VAE latents as data augmentation, introducing complex pipelines including extra noising and denoising steps. Second, they use a pretrained and frozen VAE encoder, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction and generation quality. In this paper, we find that the two issues can be solved in a very simple way: just fixing the variance (which would otherwise be predicted by the VAE encoder) to a constant (e.g., 0.5). On the one hand, this method allows the encoder to output a broader distribution of tokens and the decoder to learn to reconstruct clean images from the augmented token distribution, avoiding additional noise or denoising design. On the other hand, fixed variance simplifies the VAE evidence lower bound, making it stable to train an NF with a VAE jointly. On the ImageNet $256 \times 256$ generation task, our model SimFlow obtains a gFID score of 2.15, outperforming the state-of-the-art method STARFlow (gFID 2.40). Moreover, SimFlow can be seamlessly integrated with the end-to-end representation alignment (REPA-E) method and achieves an improved gFID of 1.91, setting a new state of the art among NFs.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03566
**Authors:** Hao Sun, Lei Fan, Donglin Di, Shaohui Liu

**Abstract:**  Articulated object generation has seen increasing advancements, yet existing models often lack the ability to be conditioned on text prompts. To address the significant gap between textual descriptions and 3D articulated object representations, we propose GAOT, a three-phase framework that generates articulated objects from text prompts, leveraging diffusion models and hypergraph learning in a three-step process. First, we fine-tune a point cloud generation model to produce a coarse representation of objects from text prompts. Given the inherent connection between articulated objects and graph structures, we design a hypergraph-based learning method to refine these coarse representations, representing object parts as graph vertices. Finally, leveraging a diffusion model, the joints of articulated objects-represented as graph edges-are generated based on the object parts. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on the PartNet-Mobility dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior performance over previous methods.

**Comment:** This paper proposes GAOT, a text-guided diffusion model for generating articulated 3D objects. It is relevant to generative modeling and multi-modal learning, but does not directly match the four criteria.

## 37. [Beyond Playtesting: A Generative Multi-Agent Simulation System for Massively Multiplayer Online Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02358) <a id="link37"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.02358
**Authors:** Ran Zhang, Kun Ouyang, Tiancheng Ma, Yida Yang, Dong Fang

**Abstract:**  Optimizing numerical systems and mechanism design is crucial for enhancing player experience in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games. Traditional optimization approaches rely on large-scale online experiments or parameter tuning over predefined statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and may disrupt player experience. Although simplified offline simulation systems are often adopted as alternatives, their limited fidelity prevents agents from accurately mimicking real player reasoning and reactions to interventions. To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on large-scale real player behavioral data, we adapt LLMs from general priors to game-specific domains, enabling realistic and interpretable player decision-making. In parallel, a data-driven environment model trained on real gameplay logs reconstructs dynamic in-game systems. Experiments demonstrate strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient framework for data-driven numerical design optimization.

**Comment:** This paper presents a generative multi-agent simulation system for MMO games using LLMs. While it uses LLMs and generative agents, it does not focus on spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI benchmarks, or vision foundation models.

## 38. [COPE: Chain-Of-Thought Prediction Engine for Open-Source Large Language Model Based Stroke Outcome Prediction from Clinical Notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02499) <a id="link38"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.02499
**Authors:** Yongkai Liu, Helena Feng, Bin Jiang, Yixin Wang, Max Wintermark, David S. Liebeskind, Michael Moseley, Maarten Lansberg, Gregory Albers, Jeremy Heit, Greg Zaharchuk

**Abstract:**  Predicting outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) guides clinical decision-making, patient counseling, and resource allocation. Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries. These findings demonstrate that COPE, a lightweight, interpretable, and privacy-preserving open-source framework, provides an accurate and practical solution for outcome prediction from unstructured clinical text.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03643
**Authors:** Ivan Yee Lee, Cheng Yang, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick

**Abstract:**  DeepSeek-OCR demonstrates that rendered text can be reconstructed with high fidelity from a small number of vision tokens. This finding has sparked excitement about vision-based context compression for language models. But the evaluation stops at reconstruction; whether these representations help language modeling remains untested. We test two assumptions implicit in the optical-compression narrative: that vision-based compression provides unique advantages for text reconstruction from compressed representations, and that DeepSeek-OCR's reconstruction results are evidence that vision-based compression will be useful for language modeling. Comparing their vision encoder against simple alternatives--parameter-free mean pooling and a learned hierarchical encoder--we find that these simple approaches match or surpass vision for reconstruction at matched compression ratios, and outperform it for language modeling--where vision-based compression fails to beat truncation. The excitement around optical context compression outpaces the evidence. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/ivnle/bad-autoencoding

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.04007
**Authors:** Marcelo Isaias de Moraes Junior, Moacir Antonelli Ponti

**Abstract:**  Sketches are simple human hand-drawn abstractions of complex scenes and real-world objects. Although the field of sketch representation learning has advanced significantly, there is still a gap in understanding the true relevance of the temporal aspect to the quality of these representations. This work investigates whether it is indeed justifiable to treat sketches as sequences, as well as which internal orders play a more relevant role. The results indicate that, although the use of traditional positional encodings is valid for modeling sketches as sequences, absolute coordinates consistently outperform relative ones. Furthermore, non-autoregressive decoders outperform their autoregressive counterparts. Finally, the importance of temporality was shown to depend on both the order considered and the task evaluated.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03597
**Authors:** Fuchen Zheng, Xinyi Chen, Weixuan Li, Quanjun Li, Junhua Zhou, Xiaojiao Guo, Xuhang Chen, Chi-Man Pun, Shoujun Zhou

**Abstract:**  Medical image segmentation is a cornerstone of modern clinical diagnostics. While Vision Transformers that leverage shifted window-based self-attention have established new benchmarks in this field, they are often hampered by a critical limitation: their localized attention mechanism struggles to effectively fuse local details with global context. This deficiency is particularly detrimental to challenging tasks such as the segmentation of microtumors and miniature organs, where both fine-grained boundary definition and broad contextual understanding are paramount. To address this gap, we propose HBFormer, a novel Hybrid-Bridge Transformer architecture. The 'Hybrid' design of HBFormer synergizes a classic U-shaped encoder-decoder framework with a powerful Swin Transformer backbone for robust hierarchical feature extraction. The core innovation lies in its 'Bridge' mechanism, a sophisticated nexus for multi-scale feature integration. This bridge is architecturally embodied by our novel Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MFF) decoder. Departing from conventional symmetric designs, the MFF decoder is engineered to fuse multi-scale features from the encoder with global contextual information. It achieves this through a synergistic combination of channel and spatial attention modules, which are constructed from a series of dilated and depth-wise convolutions. These components work in concert to create a powerful feature bridge that explicitly captures long-range dependencies and refines object boundaries with exceptional precision. Comprehensive experiments on challenging medical image segmentation datasets, including multi-organ, liver tumor, and bladder tumor benchmarks, demonstrate that HBFormer achieves state-of-the-art results, showcasing its outstanding capabilities in microtumor and miniature organ segmentation. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/lzeeorno/HBFormer.

## 42. [Difference Decomposition Networks for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03470) <a id="link42"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03470
**Authors:** Chen Hu, Mingyu Zhou, Shuai Yuan, Hongbo Hu, Xiangyu Qiu, Junhai Luo, Tian Pu, Xiyin Li

**Abstract:**  Infrared small target detection (ISTD) faces two major challenges: a lack of discernible target texture and severe background clutter, which results in the background obscuring the target. To enhance targets and suppress backgrounds, we propose the Basis Decomposition Module (BDM) as an extensible and lightweight module based on basis decomposition, which decomposes a complex feature into several basis features and enhances certain information while eliminating redundancy. Extending BDM leads to a series of modules, including the Spatial Difference Decomposition Module (SD$^\mathrm{2}$M), Spatial Difference Decomposition Downsampling Module (SD$^\mathrm{3}$M), and Temporal Difference Decomposition Module (TD$^\mathrm{2}$M). Based on these modules, we develop the Spatial Difference Decomposition Network (SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net) for single-frame ISTD (SISTD) and the Spatiotemporal Difference Decomposition Network (STD$^\mathrm{2}$Net) for multi-frame ISTD (MISTD). SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net integrates SD$^\mathrm{2}$M and SD$^\mathrm{3}$M within an adapted U-shaped architecture. We employ TD$^\mathrm{2}$M to introduce motion information, which transforms SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net into STD$^\mathrm{2}$Net. Extensive experiments on SISTD and MISTD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. On the SISTD task, SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net performs well compared to most established networks. On the MISTD datasets, STD$^\mathrm{2}$Net achieves a mIoU of 87.68\%, outperforming SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net, which achieves a mIoU of 64.97\%.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03593
**Authors:** David Svitov, Pietro Morerio, Lourdes Agapito, Alessio Del Bue

**Abstract:**  We present a CloseUpAvatar - a novel approach for articulated human avatar representation dealing with more general camera motions, while preserving rendering quality for close-up views. CloseUpAvatar represents an avatar as a set of textured planes with two sets of learnable textures for low and high-frequency detail. The method automatically switches to high-frequency textures only for cameras positioned close to the avatar's surface and gradually reduces their impact as the camera moves farther away. Such parametrization of the avatar enables CloseUpAvatar to adjust rendering quality based on camera distance ensuring realistic rendering across a wider range of camera orientations than previous approaches. We provide experiments using the ActorsHQ dataset with high-resolution input images. CloseUpAvatar demonstrates both qualitative and quantitative improvements over existing methods in rendering from novel wide range camera positions, while maintaining high FPS by limiting the number of required primitives.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03598
**Authors:** Jianan Sun, Yukang Huang, Dongzhihan Wang, Mingyu Fan

**Abstract:**  Partial dental point clouds often suffer from large missing regions caused by occlusion and limited scanning views, which bias encoder-only global features and force decoders to hallucinate structures. We propose a retrieval-augmented framework for tooth completion that integrates a prototype memory into standard encoder--decoder pipelines. After encoding a partial input into a global descriptor, the model retrieves the nearest manifold prototype from a learnable memory and fuses it with the query feature through confidence-gated weighting before decoding. The memory is optimized end-to-end and self-organizes into reusable tooth-shape prototypes without requiring tooth-position labels, thereby providing structural priors that stabilize missing-region inference and free decoder capacity for detail recovery. The module is plug-and-play and compatible with common completion backbones, while keeping the same training losses. Experiments on a self-processed Teeth3DS benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements in Chamfer Distance, with visualizations showing sharper cusps, ridges, and interproximal transitions. Our approach provides a simple yet effective way to exploit cross-sample regularities for more accurate and faithful dental point-cloud completion.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03574
**Authors:** Fuxiang Yang, Tonghua Su, Donglin Di, Yin Chen, Xiangqian Wu, Zhongjie Wang, Lei Fan

**Abstract:**  Scene Text Editing (STE) involves replacing text in a scene image with new target text while preserving both the original text style and background texture. Existing methods suffer from two major challenges: inconsistency and length-insensitivity. They often fail to maintain coherence between the edited local patch and the surrounding area, and they struggle to handle significant differences in text length before and after editing. To tackle these challenges, we propose an end-to-end framework called Global-Local Aware Scene Text Editing (GLASTE), which simultaneously incorporates high-level global contextual information along with delicate local features. Specifically, we design a global-local combination structure, joint global and local losses, and enhance text image features to ensure consistency in text style within local patches while maintaining harmony between local and global areas. Additionally, we express the text style as a vector independent of the image size, which can be transferred to target text images of various sizes. We use an affine fusion to fill target text images into the editing patch while maintaining their aspect ratio unchanged. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that our GLASTE model outperforms previous methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative results and effectively mitigates the two challenges.

## 46. [Ultra-lightweight Neural Video Representation Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04019) <a id="link46"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.04019
**Authors:** Ho Man Kwan, Tianhao Peng, Ge Gao, Fan Zhang, Mike Nilsson, Andrew Gower, David Bull

**Abstract:**  Recent works have demonstrated the viability of utilizing over-fitted implicit neural representations (INRs) as alternatives to autoencoder-based models for neural video compression. Among these INR-based video codecs, Neural Video Representation Compression (NVRC) was the first to adopt a fully end-to-end compression framework that compresses INRs, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, some recently proposed lightweight INRs have shown comparable performance to their baseline codecs with computational complexity lower than 10kMACs/pixel. In this work, we extend NVRC toward lightweight representations, and propose NVRC-Lite, which incorporates two key changes. Firstly, we integrated multi-scale feature grids into our lightweight neural representation, and the use of higher resolution grids significantly improves the performance of INRs at low complexity. Secondly, we address the issue that existing INRs typically leverage autoregressive models for entropy coding: these are effective but impractical due to their slow coding speed. In this work, we propose an octree-based context model for entropy coding high-dimensional feature grids, which accelerates the entropy coding module of the model. Our experimental results demonstrate that NVRC-Lite outperforms C3, one of the best lightweight INR-based video codecs, with up to 21.03% and 23.06% BD-rate savings when measured in PSNR and MS-SSIM, respectively, while achieving 8.4x encoding and 2.5x decoding speedup. The implementation of NVRC-Lite will be made available.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.03964
**Authors:** Lianyu Pang, Ji Zhou, Qiping Wang, Baoquan Zhao, Zhenguo Yang, Qing Li, Xudong Mao

**Abstract:**  Tuning-free face personalization methods have developed along two distinct paradigms: text embedding approaches that map facial features into the text embedding space, and adapter-based methods that inject features through auxiliary cross-attention layers. While both paradigms have shown promise, existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve high identity fidelity and flexible text controllability. We introduce UniID, a unified tuning-free framework that synergistically integrates both paradigms. Our key insight is that when merging these approaches, they should mutually reinforce only identity-relevant information while preserving the original diffusion prior for non-identity attributes. We realize this through a principled training-inference strategy: during training, we employ an identity-focused learning scheme that guides both branches to capture identity features exclusively; at inference, we introduce a normalized rescaling mechanism that recovers the text controllability of the base diffusion model while enabling complementary identity signals to enhance each other. This principled design enables UniID to achieve high-fidelity face personalization with flexible text controllability. Extensive experiments against six state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that UniID achieves superior performance in both identity preservation and text controllability. Code will be available at https://github.com/lyuPang/UniID

**Authors:** Dawei Li, Abdullah Alnaibari, Arslan Bisharat, Manny Sandoval, Deborah Hall, Yasin Silva, Huan Liu

**Abstract:**  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for AI for good applications. As LLMs increasingly mediate online communication, their potential to foster empathy and constructive dialogue becomes an important frontier for responsible AI research. This work explores whether LLMs can serve not only as moderators that detect harmful content, but as mediators capable of understanding and de-escalating online conflicts. Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLMs as emerging agents for online social mediation.
