        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.27492v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal reasoning requires iterative coordination between language and vision, yet it remains unclear what constitutes a meaningful interleaved chain of thought. We posit that text and image thoughts should function as complementary, rather than isomorphic, modalities that mutually advance reasoning. Guided by this principle, we build ThinkMorph, a unified model fine-tuned on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with varying visual engagement. ThinkMorph learns to generate progressive text-image reasoning steps that concretely manipulate visual content while maintaining coherent verbal logic. It delivers large gains on vision-centric benchmarks (averaging 34.7% over the base model) and generalizes to out-of-domain tasks, matching or surpassing larger and proprietary VLMs. Beyond performance, ThinkMorph exhibits emergent multimodal intelligence, including unseen visual manipulation skills, adaptive switching between reasoning modes, and better test-time scaling through diversified multimodal thoughts.These findings suggest promising directions for characterizing the emergent capabilities of unified models for multimodal reasoning.",

However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images, offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements. Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch. Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities. We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks.

However, existing methods extract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a single feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address this, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns tree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities. Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework that applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual features with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the two modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to effectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL distance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an intermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold. Experiments on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines under few-shot and cross-domain settings.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.27164v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels). Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models, large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused, region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.",

In 3D visual geometry reconstruction, large-scale training has likewise proven effective for learning versatile representations. However, further scaling of 3D models is challenging due to the complexity of geometric supervision and the diversity of 3D data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoRE, a dense 3D visual foundation model based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that dynamically routes features to task-specific experts, allowing them to specialize in complementary data aspects and enhance both scalability and adaptability. Aiming to improve robustness under real-world conditions, MoRE incorporates a confidence-based depth refinement module that stabilizes and refines geometric estimation. In addition, it integrates dense semantic features with globally aligned 3D backbone representations for high-fidelity surface normal prediction. MoRE is further optimized with tailored loss functions to ensure robust learning across diverse inputs and multiple geometric tasks.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.27623v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data. These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world deployment.",

While most recent 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small-scale indoor scenes, developing 3DGS-based SLAM methods for large-scale forest scenes holds great potential for many real-world applications, especially for wildfire emergency response and forest management. However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of a comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over real-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have built a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM in wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric Dreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect aerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of additional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also provides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and types and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks covering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond.

Our pipeline procedurally generates a specified type of gauge with controllable visual appearance, enabling scalable variation in key details such as pointers, scales, fonts, lighting, and clutter. Evaluation on popular proprietary and open-weight VLMs shows that even the strongest frontier VLMs struggle measurement reading in general. A consistent failure mode is indicator localization: models can read digits or labels but misidentify the key positions of pointers or alignments, leading to big numeric errors despite plausible textual reasoning. We have also conducted preliminary experiments with reinforcement learning over synthetic data, and find encouraging results on in-domain synthetic subset but less promising for real-world images.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.27219v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a vital tool for fine-grained land-use and land-cover (LULC) mapping. However, the inherent heterogeneity of HSI data has long posed a major barrier to developing generalized models via joint training. Although HSI foundation models have shown promise for different downstream tasks, the existing approaches typically overlook the critical guiding role of sensor meta-attributes, and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their transferability. To address these challenges, we propose SpecAware, which is a novel hyperspectral spectral-content aware foundation model for unifying multi-sensor learning for HSI mapping. We also constructed the Hyper-400K dataset to facilitate this research, which is a new large-scale, high-quality benchmark dataset with over 400k image patches from diverse airborne AVIRIS sensors. The core of SpecAware is a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding process for HSI data. Firstly, we designed a meta-content aware module to generate a unique conditional input for each HSI patch, tailored to each spectral band of every sample by fusing the sensor meta-attributes and its own image content. Secondly, we designed the HyperEmbedding module, where a sample-conditioned hypernetwork dynamically generates a pair of matrix factors for channel-wise encoding, consisting of adaptive spatial pattern extraction and latent semantic feature re-projection. Thus, SpecAware gains the ability to perceive and interpret spatial-spectral features across diverse scenes and sensors. This, in turn, allows SpecAware to adaptively process a variable number of spectral channels, establishing a unified framework for joint pre-training. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SpecAware can learn superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic segmentation classification, change detection, and scene classification.",

However, these models often require large-scale training data and significant computational resources to train, or suffer from heavy structure with high latency. To this end, we propose Efficient Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (E-MMDiT), an efficient and lightweight multimodal diffusion model with only 304M parameters for fast image synthesis requiring low training resources. We provide an easily reproducible baseline with competitive results. Our model for 512px generation, trained with only 25M public data in 1.5 days on a single node of 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, achieves 0.66 on GenEval and easily reaches to 0.72 with some post-training techniques such as GRPO. Our design philosophy centers on token reduction as the computational cost scales significantly with the token count. We adopt a highly compressive visual tokenizer to produce a more compact representation and propose a novel multi-path compression module for further compression of tokens. To enhance our design, we introduce Position Reinforcement, which strengthens positional information to maintain spatial coherence, and Alternating Subregion Attention (ASA), which performs attention within subregions to further reduce computational cost. In addition, we propose AdaLN-affine, an efficient lightweight module for computing modulation parameters in transformer blocks.

The underwater scene understanding task demands multi-task perceptions from multiple granularities. However, the absence of large-scale underwater multi-task instruction-tuning datasets hinders the progress of this research. To bridge this gap, we construct NautData, a dataset containing 1.45 M image-text pairs supporting eight underwater scene understanding tasks. It enables the development and thorough evaluation of the underwater scene understanding models. Underwater image degradation is a widely recognized challenge that interferes with underwater tasks. To improve the robustness of underwater scene understanding, we introduce physical priors derived from underwater imaging models and propose a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module, which explicitly restores clear underwater information.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.27571v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow benchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training. Therefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional generalization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the co-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data. Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance toward truly universal video retrieval.",

        "title": "Realistic pedestrian-driver interaction modelling using multi-agent RL with human perceptual-motor constraints",
        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.27383v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modelling pedestrian-driver interactions is critical for understanding human road user behaviour and developing safe autonomous vehicle systems. Existing approaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or 'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack flexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor constraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in interactive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of pedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised pedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints, two with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across behavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined model with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints lead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during crossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual uncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more cautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this data-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning model, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training datasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by modelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level distributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on pedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for simulating realistic road user interactions.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.27047v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents the Autonomous Driving Segment Anything Model (AD-SAM), a fine-tuned vision foundation model for semantic segmentation in autonomous driving (AD). AD-SAM extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with a dual-encoder and deformable decoder tailored to spatial and geometric complexity of road scenes. The dual-encoder produces multi-scale fused representations by combining global semantic context from SAM's pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT-H) with local spatial detail from a trainable convolutional deep learning backbone (i.e., ResNet-50). A deformable fusion module aligns heterogeneous features across scales and object geometries. The decoder performs progressive multi-stage refinement using deformable attention. Training is guided by a hybrid loss that integrates Focal, Dice, Lovasz-Softmax, and Surface losses, improving semantic class balance, boundary precision, and optimization stability. Experiments on the Cityscapes and Berkeley DeepDrive 100K (BDD100K) benchmarks show that AD-SAM surpasses SAM, Generalized SAM (G-SAM), and a deep learning baseline (DeepLabV3) in segmentation accuracy. It achieves 68.1 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by margins of up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU in structured and diverse road scenes, respectively. AD-SAM demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization with a 0.87 retention score (vs. 0.76 for SAM), and faster, more stable learning dynamics, converging within 30-40 epochs, enjoying double the learning speed of benchmark models. It maintains 0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples, suggesting data efficiency critical for reducing annotation costs.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.27236v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Eliminating geometric distortion in semantically important regions remains an intractable challenge in image retargeting. This paper presents Object-IR, a self-supervised architecture that reformulates image retargeting as a learning-based mesh warping optimization problem, where the mesh deformation is guided by object appearance consistency and geometric-preserving constraints. Given an input image and a target aspect ratio, we initialize a uniform rigid mesh at the output resolution and use a convolutional neural network to predict the motion of each mesh grid and obtain the deformed mesh. The retargeted result is generated by warping the input image according to the rigid mesh in the input image and the deformed mesh in the output resolution. To mitigate geometric distortion, we design a comprehensive objective function incorporating a) object-consistent loss to ensure that the important semantic objects retain their appearance, b) geometric-preserving loss to constrain simple scale transform of the important meshes, and c) boundary loss to enforce a clean rectangular output. Notably, our self-supervised paradigm eliminates the need for manually annotated retargeting datasets by deriving supervision directly from the input's geometric and semantic properties. Extensive evaluations on the RetargetMe benchmark demonstrate that our Object-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in quantitative metrics and subjective visual quality assessments. The framework efficiently processes arbitrary input resolutions (average inference time: 0.009s for 1024x683 resolution) while maintaining real-time performance on consumer-grade GPUs.

To address this issue, we propose an innovative approach that harnesses web-crawled descriptions, leveraging a large-language model to extract relevant keywords. This method reduces the need for human annotators and eliminates the laborious manual process of attribute data creation. Additionally, we introduce a spatio-temporal interaction module designed to focus on objects and action units, facilitating alignment between description attributes and video content.

In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability, including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring. By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities. Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and strategy coding.",

However, automated analysis of historical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide stylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing linked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information from multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating buildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying environmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for automatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a visual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with few-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images and time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video, enabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from similar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal features. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time Series Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time series from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations. Experimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively and can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited supervision or using pseudo videos.

Existing model-merging techniques, designed for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to deliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static interpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we introduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3 dynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to generalist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of sample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that computes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing computational bottleneck. Recognizing the lack of a standardized medical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol spanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities. Empirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error reduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving the way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings.

Recent advances in the pathological foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving meaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs. However, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity caused by diverse private training datasets and different network architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we utilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To fully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we propose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs, called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.",

While existing caching techniques can accelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel hierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model architectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising process can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a detail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold system, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure the efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature summarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity estimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that H2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining image quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and qualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a robust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality dilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of high-fidelity diffusion models.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.27285v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Concept erasure aims to selectively unlearning undesirable content in diffusion models (DMs) to reduce the risk of sensitive content generation. As a novel paradigm in concept erasure, most existing methods employ adversarial training to identify and suppress target concepts, thus reducing the likelihood of sensitive outputs. However, these methods often neglect the specificity of adversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this work, we investigate and quantify this specificity from the perspective of concept space, i.e., can adversarial samples truly fit the target concept space? We observe that existing methods neglect the role of conceptual semantics when generating adversarial samples, resulting in ineffective fitting of concept spaces. This oversight leads to the following issues: 1) when there are few adversarial samples, they fail to comprehensively cover the object concept; 2) conversely, they will disrupt other target concept spaces. Motivated by the analysis of these findings, we introduce S-GRACE (Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure), which grace leveraging semantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and perform erasure training. Experiments conducted with seven state-of-the-art methods and three adversarial prompt generation strategies across various DM unlearning scenarios demonstrate that S-GRACE significantly improves erasure performance 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training time by 90%.

Whereas the conventional ADC bases its primitive splitting on the magnitudes of positional gradients, we further incorporate the DC of the gradients into ADC, and realize it through the angular coherence of the gradients. Our DC better captures local structural complexities in ADC, avoiding redundant splitting. When splitting is required, we again utilize the DC to define optimal split positions so that sub-primitives best align with the local structures than the conventional random placement. As a consequence, our DC4GS greatly reduces the number of primitives (up to 30% in our experiments) than the existing ADC, and also enhances reconstruction fidelity greatly.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.27316v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into pretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the application of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains underexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class sets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook the inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring scenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task images, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that prompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across tasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated by this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection (P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD employs networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate knowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD further engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's effectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among existing baselines.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.27432v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the content matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video pair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic variation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently, embeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for distinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of semantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven apart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse events. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic collapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text Correlation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships encoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in video embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive alignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across temporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and adaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are internally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.27266v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents rely on accurate GUI grounding, which maps language instructions to on-screen coordinates, to execute user commands. However, current models, whether trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), lack self-awareness of their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable predictions. We first systematically evaluate probabilistic and verbalized confidence in general and GUI-specific models, revealing a misalignment between confidence and actual accuracy, which is particularly critical in dynamic GUI automation tasks, where single errors can cause task failure. To address this, we propose HyperClick, a novel framework that enhances reliable GUI grounding through uncertainty calibration. HyperClick introduces a dual reward mechanism, combining a binary reward for correct actions with a truncated Gaussian-based spatial confidence modeling, calibrated using the Brier score. This approach jointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability, fostering introspective self-criticism. Extensive experiments on seven challenge benchmarks show that HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing well-calibrated confidence. By enabling explicit confidence calibration and introspective self-criticism, HyperClick reduces overconfidence and supports more reliable GUI automation.",

Denario also excels at combining ideas from different disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies methods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We report the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who provided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.26854v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Most scientific materials compress reasoning, presenting conclusions while omitting the derivational chains that justify them. This compression hinders verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven, reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200 courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search -- retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval (as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base, this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding encyclopedia.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.27042v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve accuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance relative to the base model used for RL training.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.27599v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural networks have changed the way machines interpret the world. At their core, they learn by following gradients, adjusting their parameters step by step until they identify the most discriminant patterns in the data. This process gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw. The very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small, imperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision. Such tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this vulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while leaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong predictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive Hard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the power of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to enable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings for the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster together in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same class while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps the model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient cues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and robust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard adversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and robustness.",

Current deep learning models are typically specialized `point solutions' that lack generalization and high performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability. To address these gaps, we propose the Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive framework designed for both generalization and robustness. The framework is built on a novel hybrid architecture integrating multi-stream CNN encoders, a Swin Transformer bottleneck for global context, a dynamic cross-modal attention fusion (CMAF) mechanism, and a hierarchical gated decoder for high-fidelity mask reconstruction. The architecture is trained with a variance reduction strategy that combines pathology specific data augmentation and difficulty-aware sampling method. The model was evaluated on three different challenging public datasets: the MICCAI 2017 WMH Challenge, the ISLES 2022 Challenge, and the BraTS 2020 Challenge. Our framework attained a state-of-the-art DSC value of 0.831 with the HD95 value of 3.03 in the WMH dataset. For ISLES 2022, it achieved the best boundary accuracy with a statistically significant difference (HD95 value of 9.69). For BraTS 2020, it reached the highest DSC value for the tumor core region (0.8651). These experimental findings suggest that our unified adaptive framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, providing a robust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.27667v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Operando microscopy provides direct insight into the dynamic chemical and physical processes that govern functional materials, yet measurement noise limits the effective resolution and undermines quantitative analysis. Here, we present a general framework for integrating unsupervised deep learning-based denoising into quantitative microscopy workflows across modalities and length scales. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that deep denoising preserves physical fidelity, introduces minimal bias, and reduces uncertainty in model learning with partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization. Applied to experiments, denoising reveals nanoscale chemical and structural heterogeneity in scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) of lithium iron phosphate (LFP), enables automated particle segmentation and phase classification in optical microscopy of graphite electrodes, and reduces noise-induced variability by nearly 80% in neutron radiography to resolve heterogeneous lithium transport. Collectively, these results establish deep denoising as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances quantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of previously noise-limited techniques.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.27359v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key strategy for adapting large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks, but existing approaches face notable limitations. Addition-based methods, such as Adapters [1], introduce inference latency and engineering complexity, while selection-based methods like Gradient-based Parameter Selection (GPS) [2] require a full backward pass, which results in the same peak memory usage as full fine-tuning. To address this dilemma, we propose Feedforward-based Parameter Selection (FPS), a gradient-free method that identifies an optimal parameter subset in a single forward pass. FPS ranks parameters by the product of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both pre-trained knowledge and downstream data. Evaluated on $24$ visual tasks from FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly $9 \\times$ and accelerating parameter selection by about $2 \\times$, offering a genuinely memory-efficient and practical solution for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models.",
