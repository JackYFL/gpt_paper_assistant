In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) then unlocks the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document understanding, among others. To facilitate research in this field, we open-source GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking, which achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size. In a comprehensive evaluation across 28 public benchmarks, our model outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on nearly all tasks and achieves comparable or even superior performance on 18 benchmarks relative to the significantly larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B.

Current methods show strong dependence on object detectors, introducing processing bottlenecks and limitations in taxonomic flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a scene-centric 3D VLM for 3D Gaussian splat scenes that employs language- and task-aware scene representations. Our approach directly embeds rich linguistic features into the 3D scene representation by associating language with each Gaussian primitive, achieving early modality alignment. To process the resulting dense representations, we introduce a dual sparsifier that distills them into compact, task-relevant tokens via task-guided and location-guided pathways, producing sparse, task-aware global and local scene tokens. Notably, we present the first Gaussian splatting-based VLM, leveraging photorealistic 3D representations derived from standard RGB images, demonstrating strong generalization: it improves performance of prior 3D VLM five folds, in out-of-the-domain settings.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.00469v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Frontier vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable improvements in video understanding tasks. However, real-world videos typically exist as continuously evolving data streams (e.g., dynamic scenes captured by wearable glasses), necessitating models to continually adapt to shifting data distributions and novel scenarios. Considering the prohibitive computational costs of fine-tuning models on new tasks, usually, a small subset of parameters is updated while the bulk of the model remains frozen. This poses new challenges to existing continual learning frameworks in the context of large multimodal foundation models, i.e., catastrophic forgetting and update conflict. While the foundation models struggle with parameter-efficient continual learning, the hippocampus in the human brain has evolved highly efficient mechanisms for memory formation and consolidation. Inspired by the rapid Binding and pattern separation mechanisms in the hippocampus, in this work, we propose Bisecle for video-language continual learning, where a multi-directional supervision module is used to capture more cross-modal relationships and a contrastive prompt learning scheme is designed to isolate task-specific knowledge to facilitate efficient memory storage. Binding and separation processes further strengthen the ability of VLMs to retain complex experiences, enabling robust and efficient continual learning in video understanding tasks. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed Bisecle, demonstrating its ability to mitigate forgetting and enhance cross-task generalization on several VideoQA benchmarks.",

Existing driving-oriented VQA datasets are limited to full-scene descriptions or waypoint prediction, preventing the assessment of whether VLMs can respond to localized user-driven queries. We introduce Box-QAymo, a box-referring dataset and benchmark designed to both evaluate and finetune VLMs on spatial and temporal reasoning over user-specified objects. Users express intent by drawing bounding boxes, offering a fast and intuitive interface for focused queries in complex scenes. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical evaluation protocol that begins with binary sanity-check questions to assess basic model capacities, and progresses to (1) attribute prediction for box-referred objects, (2) motion understanding of target instances, and (3) spatiotemporal motion reasoning over inter-object dynamics across frames. To support this, we crowd-sourced fine-grained object classes and visual attributes that reflect the complexity drivers encounter, and extract object trajectories to construct temporally grounded QA pairs. Rigorous quality control through negative sampling, temporal consistency checks, and difficulty-aware balancing guarantee dataset robustness and diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals significant limitations in current VLMs when queried about perception questions, highlighting the gap in achieving real-world performance. This work provides a foundation for developing more robust and interpretable autonomous driving systems that can communicate effectively with users under real-world conditions.

We present CAVALRY-V (Cross-modal Language-Vision Adversarial Yielding for Videos), a novel framework that directly targets the critical interface between visual perception and language generation in V-MLLMs. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a dual-objective semantic-visual loss function that simultaneously disrupts the model's text generation logits and visual representations to undermine cross-modal integration, and (2) a computationally efficient two-stage generator framework that combines large-scale pre-training for cross-model transferability with specialized fine-tuning for spatiotemporal coherence. Empirical evaluation on comprehensive video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that CAVALRY-V significantly outperforms existing attack methods, achieving 22.8% average improvement over the best baseline attacks on both commercial systems (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.0) and open-source models (QwenVL-2.5, InternVL-2.5, Llava-Video, Aria, MiniCPM-o-2.6). Our framework achieves flexibility through implicit temporal coherence modeling rather than explicit regularization, enabling significant performance improvements even on image understanding (34.4% average gain).

Prior works have addressed the in-frame target localization problem with data-driven approaches by carefully removing out-of-frame samples. Vision-based gaze estimation methods, such as OpenFace, do not effectively absorb background information in images and cannot predict gaze target in situations where subjects look away from the camera. In this work, we propose a system to address the problem of 360-degree gaze target estimation from an image in generalized visual scenes. The system, named GazeTarget360, integrates conditional inference engines of an eye-contact detector, a pre-trained vision encoder, and a multi-scale-fusion decoder. Cross validation results show that GazeTarget360 can produce accurate and reliable gaze target predictions in unseen scenarios. This makes a first-of-its-kind system to predict gaze targets from realistic camera footage which is highly efficient and deployable.

Moreover, conventional feature encoders are typically trained on single-view 2D images, limiting their capacity to capture 3D-aware correspondences. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that lifts 2D images to 3D space, named as \\textbf{Lift to Match (L2M)}, taking full advantage of large-scale and diverse single-view images. To be specific, in the first stage, we learn a 3D-aware feature encoder using a combination of multi-view image synthesis and 3D feature Gaussian representation, which injects 3D geometry knowledge into the encoder. In the second stage, a novel-view rendering strategy, combined with large-scale synthetic data generation from single-view images, is employed to learn a feature decoder for robust feature matching, thus achieving generalization across diverse domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior generalization across zero-shot evaluation benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed framework for robust feature matching.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.00224v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Interactive and spatially aware technologies are transforming educational frameworks, particularly in K-12 settings where hands-on exploration fosters deeper conceptual understanding. However, during collaborative tasks, existing systems often lack the ability to accurately capture real-world interactions between students and physical objects. This issue could be addressed with automatic 6D pose estimation, i.e., estimation of an object's position and orientation in 3D space from RGB images or videos. For collaborative groups that interact with physical objects, 6D pose estimates allow AI systems to relate objects and entities. As part of this work, we introduce FiboSB, a novel and challenging 6D pose video dataset featuring groups of three participants solving an interactive task featuring small hand-held cubes and a weight scale. This setup poses unique challenges for 6D pose because groups are holistically recorded from a distance in order to capture all participants -- this, coupled with the small size of the cubes, makes 6D pose estimation inherently non-trivial. We evaluated four state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation methods on FiboSB, exposing the limitations of current algorithms on collaborative group work. An error analysis of these methods reveals that the 6D pose methods' object detection modules fail. We address this by fine-tuning YOLO11-x for FiboSB, achieving an overall mAP_50 of 0.898. The dataset, benchmark results, and analysis of YOLO11-x errors presented here lay the groundwork for leveraging the estimation of 6D poses in difficult collaborative contexts.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.00659v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a novel method for aerial visual localization over low Level-of-Detail (LoD) city models. Previous wireframe-alignment-based method LoD-Loc has shown promising localization results leveraging LoD models. However, LoD-Loc mainly relies on high-LoD (LoD3 or LoD2) city models, but the majority of available models and those many countries plan to construct nationwide are low-LoD (LoD1). Consequently, enabling localization on low-LoD city models could unlock drones' potential for global urban localization. To address these issues, we introduce LoD-Loc v2, which employs a coarse-to-fine strategy using explicit silhouette alignment to achieve accurate localization over low-LoD city models in the air. Specifically, given a query image, LoD-Loc v2 first applies a building segmentation network to shape building silhouettes. Then, in the coarse pose selection stage, we construct a pose cost volume by uniformly sampling pose hypotheses around a prior pose to represent the pose probability distribution. Each cost of the volume measures the degree of alignment between the projected and predicted silhouettes. We select the pose with maximum value as the coarse pose. In the fine pose estimation stage, a particle filtering method incorporating a multi-beam tracking approach is used to efficiently explore the hypothesis space and obtain the final pose estimation. To further facilitate research in this field, we release two datasets with LoD1 city models covering 10.7 km , along with real RGB queries and ground-truth pose annotations. Experimental results show that LoD-Loc v2 improves estimation accuracy with high-LoD models and enables localization with low-LoD models for the first time. Moreover, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by large margins, even surpassing texture-model-based methods, and broadens the convergence basin to accommodate larger prior errors.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.00709v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.4% mAP in lane segment perception and +2.1% OLS in centerline perception tasks.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.00721v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA) presents substantial challenges due to the lack of images in the target domain. Previous approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to tackle this challenge, exploiting their zero-shot learning capabilities. However, these methods primarily address domain distribution shifts and overlook the misalignment between the detection task and VLMs, which rely on manually crafted prompts. To overcome these limitations, we propose the unified prompt and representation enhancement (UPRE) framework, which jointly optimizes both textual prompts and visual representations. Specifically, our approach introduces a multi-view domain prompt that combines linguistic domain priors with detection-specific knowledge, and a visual representation enhancement module that produces domain style variations. Furthermore, we introduce multi-level enhancement strategies, including relative domain distance and positive-negative separation, which align multi-modal representations at the image level and capture diverse visual representations at the instance level, respectively. Extensive experiments conducted on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in ZSDA detection scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/UPRE.",

However, compared to the open accessibility and high spatiotemporal coverage of medium-resolution data, the limited acquisition channels for ultra-high-resolution optical RS imagery have constrained the progress of high-resolution remote sensing vision foundation models (RSVFM). As the world's largest sub-meter-level commercial RS satellite constellation, the Jilin-1 constellation possesses abundant sub-meter-level image resources. This study proposes CGEarthEye, a RSVFM framework specifically designed for Jilin-1 satellite characteristics, comprising five backbones with different parameter scales with totaling 2.1 billion parameters. To enhance the representational capacity of the foundation model, we developed JLSSD, the first 15-million-scale multi-temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) dataset featuring global coverage with quarterly temporal sampling within a single year, constructed through multi-level representation clustering and sampling strategies. The framework integrates seasonal contrast, augmentation-based contrast, and masked patch token contrastive strategies for pre-training. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 benchmark datasets covering four typical RS tasks demonstrate that the CGEarthEye consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Further analysis reveals CGEarthEye's superior characteristics in feature visualization, model convergence, parameter efficiency, and practical mapping applications. This study anticipates that the exceptional representation capabilities of CGEarthEye will facilitate broader and more efficient applications of Jilin-1 data in traditional EO application.",

In particular, collecting such extensive data intraoperatively is impractical due to time constraints. This work addresses this challenge by leveraging a single intraoperative image and preoperative data to train NeRF efficiently for surgical scenarios.   Methods: We leverage preoperative MRI data to define the set of camera viewpoints and images needed for robust and unobstructed training. Intraoperatively, the appearance of the surgical image is transferred to the pre-constructed training set through neural style transfer, specifically combining WTC2 and STROTSS to prevent over-stylization. This process enables the creation of a dataset for instant and fast single-image NeRF training.   Results: The method is evaluated with four clinical neurosurgical cases. Quantitative comparisons to NeRF models trained on real surgical microscope images demonstrate strong synthesis agreement, with similarity metrics indicating high reconstruction fidelity and stylistic alignment. When compared with ground truth, our method demonstrates high structural similarity, confirming good reconstruction quality and texture preservation.   Conclusion: Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of single-image NeRF training in surgical settings, overcoming the limitations of traditional multi-view methods.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.00490v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Just noticeable difference (JND), the minimum change that the human visual system (HVS) can perceive, has been studied for decades. Although recent work has extended this line of research into machine vision, there has been a scarcity of studies systematically exploring its perceptual boundaries across multiple tasks and stimulus types, particularly in the current era of rapidly advancing large multimodal models (LMMs), where studying the multifaceted capabilities of models has become a mainstream focus. Moreover, the perceptual defects of LMMs are not investigated thoroughly, resulting in potential security issues and suboptimal response efficiency. In this paper, we take an initial attempt and demonstrate that there exist significant visual blind spots in current LMMs. To systemically quantify this characteristic, we propose a new concept, {\\bf LMM-JND}, together with its determination pipeline. Targeting uncovering the behavior commonalities in HVS-aligned visual perception tasks, we delve into several LMM families and construct a large-scale dataset, named VPA-JND, which contains 21.5k reference images with over 489k stimuli across 12 distortion types, to facilitate LMM-JND studies. VPA-JND exposes areas where state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and the InternVL2.5 series, struggle with basic comparison queries and fall significantly short of human-level visual performance. We further explore the effects of vision and language backbones and find a notable correlation between their design philosophy that may instruct the future refinement of LMMs for their visual acuity. Together, our research underscores the significance of LMM-JND as a unique perspective for studying LMMs, and predictable LMM-JND is crucial for security concerns.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.00493v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humans are able to recognize objects based on both local texture cues and the configuration of object parts, yet contemporary vision models primarily harvest local texture cues, yielding brittle, non-compositional features. Work on shape-vs-texture bias has pitted shape and texture representations in opposition, measuring shape relative to texture, ignoring the possibility that models (and humans) can simultaneously rely on both types of cues, and obscuring the absolute quality of both types of representation. We therefore recast shape evaluation as a matter of absolute configural competence, operationalized by the Configural Shape Score (CSS), which (i) measures the ability to recognize both images in Object-Anagram pairs that preserve local texture while permuting global part arrangement to depict different object categories. Across 86 convolutional, transformer, and hybrid models, CSS (ii) uncovers a broad spectrum of configural sensitivity with fully self-supervised and language-aligned transformers -- exemplified by DINOv2, SigLIP2 and EVA-CLIP -- occupying the top end of the CSS spectrum. Mechanistic probes reveal that (iii) high-CSS networks depend on long-range interactions: radius-controlled attention masks abolish performance showing a distinctive U-shaped integration profile, and representational-similarity analyses expose a mid-depth transition from local to global coding. A BagNet control remains at chance (iv), ruling out \"border-hacking\" strategies. Finally, (v) we show that configural shape score also predicts other shape-dependent evals. Overall, we propose that the path toward truly robust, generalizable, and human-like vision systems may not lie in forcing an artificial choice between shape and texture, but rather in architectural and learning frameworks that seamlessly integrate both local-texture and global configural shape.",

This enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5, DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models, and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies, including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular, interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning, and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.",

However, the inherent noise in both human pose estimation and object detection often leads to over-segmentation errors, disrupting the coherence of action sequences. To address this, we propose a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) that integrates low-frame-rate (e.g., 1 fps) visual data with high-frame-rate (e.g., 30 fps) motion data (skeleton and object detections) to mitigate fragmentation. Our framework introduces three key contributions. First, a sinusoidal encoding strategy that maps 3D skeleton coordinates into a continuous sin-cos space to enhance spatial representation robustness. Second, a temporal graph fusion module that aligns multi-modal inputs with differing resolutions via hierarchical feature aggregation, Third, inspired by the smooth transitions inherent to human actions, we design SmoothLabelMix, a data augmentation technique that mixes input sequences and labels to generate synthetic training examples with gradual action transitions, enhancing temporal consistency in predictions and reducing over-segmentation artifacts.   Extensive experiments on the Bimanual Actions Dataset, a public benchmark for human-object interaction understanding, demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in action segmentation accuracy, achieving F1@10: 94.5% and F1@25: 92.8%.",

Our goal is to solve complex tasks that involve multiple intermediate steps using a single model, allowing users to define entire vision pipelines flexibly at test time. To achieve this, we first examine the properties and limitations of visual in-context learning architectures, with a particular focus on the role of codebooks. We then introduce a novel method for training in-context learners using a synthetic compositional task generation engine. This engine bootstraps task sequences from arbitrary segmentation datasets, enabling the training of visual in-context learners for compositional tasks. Additionally, we investigate different masking-based training objectives to gather insights into how to train models better for solving complex, compositional tasks.

While existing methods perform well on short videos, they often struggle with long-range reasoning in longer videos. To scale Video LLMs for longer video content, frame sub-sampling (selecting frames at regular intervals) is commonly used. However, this approach is suboptimal, often leading to the loss of crucial frames or the inclusion of redundant information from multiple similar frames. Missing key frames impairs the model's ability to answer questions accurately, while redundant frames lead the model to focus on irrelevant video segments and increase computational resource consumption. In this paper, we investigate the use of a general-purpose text-to-video moment retrieval model to guide the frame sampling process. We propose \"moment sampling\", a novel, model-agnostic approach that enables the model to select the most relevant frames according to the context of the question. Specifically, we employ a lightweight moment retrieval model to prioritize frame selection. By focusing on the frames most pertinent to the given question, our method enhances long-form VideoQA performance in Video LLMs. Through extensive experiments on four long-form VideoQA datasets, using four state-of-the-art Video LLMs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Previous trackers have explored many effective feature modification methods to preserve more aligned features. However, an important yet unexplored factor ultimately hinders their capability, which is the inherent differences in the temporal and spatial scale of information between visual and language inputs. To address this issue, we propose a novel visual-language tracker that enhances the effect of feature modification by \\textbf{A}ligning \\textbf{T}emporal and \\textbf{S}patial scale of different input components, named as \\textbf{ATSTrack}. Specifically, we decompose each language description into phrases with different attributes based on their temporal and spatial correspondence with visual inputs, and modify their features in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, we introduce a Visual-Language token that comprises modified linguistic information from the previous frame to guide the model to extract visual features that are more relevant to language description, thereby reducing the impact caused by the differences in spatial scale.

Recently, training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) has led to the advent of reasoning models with greatly enhanced reasoning capabilities. Open-source replications of reasoning models, while successful, build upon models that already exhibit strong reasoning capabilities along with search behavior observed even before RL. As a result, it is yet unclear how to boost the reasoning capabilities of other non-reasoner models including Llama 3. ASTRO teaches such models to internalize structured search behavior through a synthetic dataset derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over mathematical problem-solving trajectories. By converting search traces into natural language chain-of-thoughts that capture both successes and recoveries from failure, ASTRO bootstraps models with a rich prior for exploration during RL. We finetune our models on these search-derived traces and further improve performance via RL with verifiable rewards. We apply ASTRO to the Llama 3 family of models and achieve absolute performance gains of 16.0% on MATH-500, 26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, especially improving upon challenging problems that require iterative correction.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.01012v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-world video super-resolution (VSR) presents significant challenges due to complex and unpredictable degradations. Although some recent methods utilize image diffusion models for VSR and have shown improved detail generation capabilities, they still struggle to produce temporally consistent frames. We attempt to use Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) combined with ControlNet to address this issue. However, due to the intrinsic image-animation characteristics of SVD, it is challenging to generate fine details using only low-quality videos. To tackle this problem, we propose DAM-VSR, an appearance and motion disentanglement framework for VSR. This framework disentangles VSR into appearance enhancement and motion control problems. Specifically, appearance enhancement is achieved through reference image super-resolution, while motion control is achieved through video ControlNet. This disentanglement fully leverages the generative prior of video diffusion models and the detail generation capabilities of image super-resolution models. Furthermore, equipped with the proposed motion-aligned bidirectional sampling strategy, DAM-VSR can conduct VSR on longer input videos. DAM-VSR achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world data and AIGC data, demonstrating its powerful detail generation capabilities.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.00373v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression optimizes bit allocation by prioritizing ROI for higher-quality reconstruction. However, as the users (including human clients and downstream machine tasks) become more diverse, ROI-based image compression needs to be customizable to support various preferences. For example, different users may define distinct ROI or require different quality trade-offs between ROI and non-ROI. Existing ROI-based image compression schemes predefine the ROI, making it unchangeable, and lack effective mechanisms to balance reconstruction quality between ROI and non-ROI. This work proposes a paradigm for customizable ROI-based deep image compression. First, we develop a Text-controlled Mask Acquisition (TMA) module, which allows users to easily customize their ROI for compression by just inputting the corresponding semantic \\emph{text}. It makes the encoder controlled by text. Second, we design a Customizable Value Assign (CVA) mechanism, which masks the non-ROI with a changeable extent decided by users instead of a constant one to manage the reconstruction quality trade-off between ROI and non-ROI. Finally, we present a Latent Mask Attention (LMA) module, where the latent spatial prior of the mask and the latent Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) prior of the image are extracted and fused in the latent space, and further used to optimize the latent representation of the source image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed customizable ROI-based deep image compression paradigm effectively addresses the needs of customization for ROI definition and mask acquisition as well as the reconstruction quality trade-off management between the ROI and non-ROI.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.00447v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Perception-Distortion tradeoff (PD-tradeoff) theory suggests that face restoration algorithms must balance perceptual quality and fidelity. To achieve minimal distortion while maintaining perfect perceptual quality, Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF) proposes a flow based approach where source distribution is minimum distortion estimations. Although PMRF is shown to be effective, its pixel-space modeling approach limits its ability to align with human perception, where human perception is defined as how humans distinguish between two image distributions. In this work, we propose Latent-PMRF, which reformulates PMRF in the latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE), facilitating better alignment with human perception during optimization. By defining the source distribution on latent representations of minimum distortion estimation, we bound the minimum distortion by the VAE's reconstruction error. Moreover, we reveal the design of VAE is crucial, and our proposed VAE significantly outperforms existing VAEs in both reconstruction and restoration. Extensive experiments on blind face restoration demonstrate the superiority of Latent-PMRF, offering an improved PD-tradeoff compared to existing methods, along with remarkable convergence efficiency, achieving a 5.79X speedup over PMRF in terms of FID.

We propose MS-TTA, a training-free approach that enhances feature representations beyond CLIP's space using a single-step k-nearest neighbors (kNN) Mean-Shift. By refining all test samples, MS-TTA improves feature compactness and class separability, leading to more stable adaptation. Additionally, a cache of refined embeddings further enhances inference by providing Mean Shift enhanced logits.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.00501v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent progress in image restoration has underscored Spatial State Models (SSMs) as powerful tools for modeling long-range dependencies, owing to their appealing linear complexity and computational efficiency. However, SSM-based approaches exhibit limitations in reconstructing localized structures and tend to be less effective when handling high-dimensional data, frequently resulting in suboptimal recovery of fine image features. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Laplace-Mamba, a novel framework that integrates Laplace frequency prior with a hybrid Mamba-CNN architecture for efficient image dehazing. Leveraging the Laplace decomposition, the image is disentangled into low-frequency components capturing global texture and high-frequency components representing edges and fine details. This decomposition enables specialized processing via dual parallel pathways: the low-frequency branch employs SSMs for global context modeling, while the high-frequency branch utilizes CNNs to refine local structural details, effectively addressing diverse haze scenarios. Notably, the Laplace transformation facilitates information-preserving downsampling of low-frequency components in accordance with the Nyquist theory, thereby significantly improving computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both restoration quality and efficiency.

Handling the low-quality and static embeddings produced by frozen, \"black-box\" backbones leads to a problem representation of few-shot classification as a series of multiple instance verification (MIV) tasks. Inspired by this representation, we introduce a novel approach to few-shot domain adaptation, named the \"MIV-head\", akin to a classification head that is agnostic to any pretrained backbone and computationally efficient. The core components designed for the MIV-head, when trained on few-shot data from a target domain, collectively yield strong performance on test data from that domain. Importantly, it does so without fine-tuning the backbone, and within the \"meta-testing\" phase. Experimenting under various settings and on an extension of the Meta-dataset benchmark for cross-domain few-shot image classification, using representative off-the-shelf convolutional neural network and vision transformer backbones pretrained on ImageNet1K, we show that the MIV-head achieves highly competitive accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art \"adapter\" (or partially fine-tuning) methods applied to the same backbones, while incurring substantially lower adaptation cost. We also find well-known \"classification head\" approaches lag far behind in terms of accuracy. Ablation study empirically justifies the core components of our approach.

Current algorithms often depend on hand-crafted components like anchor boxes, which demand fine-tuning and exhibit limited generalization, and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), which is threshold-sensitive and prone to misclassifying dense objects. These generic architectures thus struggle to adapt to aerial imaging characteristics, resulting in performance limitations. Moreover, emerging end-to-end frameworks have yet to effectively mitigate these aerial-specific challenges.To address these issues, we propose HEGS-DETR, a comprehensively enhanced, real-time Detection Transformer framework tailored for UAVs. First, we introduce the High-Frequency Enhanced Semantics Network (HFESNet) as a novel backbone. HFESNet preserves critical high-frequency spatial details to extract robust semantic features, thereby improving discriminative capability for small and occluded targets in complex backgrounds. Second, our Efficient Small Object Pyramid (ESOP) strategy strategically fuses high-resolution feature maps with minimal computational overhead, significantly boosting small object detection. Finally, the proposed Selective Query Recollection (SQR) and Geometry-Aware Positional Encoding (GAPE) modules enhance the detector's decoder stability and localization accuracy, effectively optimizing bounding boxes and providing explicit spatial priors for dense scenes. Experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate that HEGS-DETR achieves a 5.1\\% AP$_{50}$ and 3.8\\% AP increase over the baseline, while maintaining real-time speed and reducing parameter count by 4M.",

But as math leaderboards improve week by week, it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20 open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for advancing reasoning models.",

DMW-LA also dynamically updates the similarity memory prior in reverse through Weight-Loss Dynamic (W-LD) update strategy, effectively assisting the network directly extract category features.
