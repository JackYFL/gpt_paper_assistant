        "abstract": "arXiv:2512.05131v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Active 3D reconstruction enables an agent to autonomously select viewpoints to efficiently obtain accurate and complete scene geometry, rather than passively reconstructing scenes from pre-collected images. However, existing active reconstruction methods often rely on hand-crafted geometric heuristics, which can lead to redundant observations without substantially improving reconstruction quality. To address this limitation, we propose AREA3D, an active reconstruction agent that leverages feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and vision-language guidance. Our framework decouples view-uncertainty modeling from the underlying feed-forward reconstructor, enabling precise uncertainty estimation without expensive online optimization. In addition, an integrated vision-language model provides high-level semantic guidance, encouraging informative and diverse viewpoints beyond purely geometric cues. Extensive experiments on both scene-level and object-level benchmarks demonstrate that AREA3D achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy, particularly in the sparse-view regime.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2512.05774v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) is challenging because answering real-world queries often depends on sparse, temporally dispersed cues buried in hours of mostly redundant and irrelevant content. While agentic pipelines improve video reasoning capabilities, prevailing frameworks rely on a query-agnostic captioner to perceive video information, which wastes computation on irrelevant content and blurs fine-grained temporal and spatial information. Motivated by active perception theory, we argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, and continuously assess whether the current observation is sufficient to answer the query. We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens.",

Existing approaches improve instruction adherence via supervised or reinforcement learning, yet single-turn success rates remain limited due to inherent stochasticity and a lack of deliberation. In this work, we propose a deliberative editing framework to 'think' while they edit, which simulates the human cognitive loop by iteratively executing a Think-while-Edit cycle: Critiquing results and Refining instructions , followed by Repeating the generation until satisfactory. Specifically, we train a single MLLM, EditThinker, to act as the reasoning engine of this framework, which jointly produce the critique score, reasoning process, and refined instructions. We employ reinforcement learning to align the EditThinker's thinking with its editing, thereby generating more targeted instruction improvements.

Despite recent advancements in DETR-style single-stage ST-SGG models, they still suffer from several key limitations. First, while these models rely on attention-based learnable queries as a core component, these learnable queries are semantically uninformed and instance-agnostically initialized. Second, these models rely exclusively on unimodal visual features for predicate classification. To address these challenges, we propose VOST-SGG, a VLM-aided one-stage ST-SGG framework that integrates the common sense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) into the ST-SGG pipeline. First, we introduce the dual-source query initialization strategy that disentangles what to attend to from where to attend, enabling semantically grounded what-where reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal feature bank that fuses visual, textual, and spatial cues derived from VLMs for improved predicate classification.

Existing approaches predominantly rely on text or image prompts, which often fall short in geometric specificity: language can be ambiguous, and images are cumbersome to edit. In this work, we introduce SpaceControl, a training-free test-time method for explicit spatial control of 3D generation. Our approach accepts a wide range of geometric inputs, from coarse primitives to detailed meshes, and integrates seamlessly with modern pre-trained generative models without requiring any additional training. A controllable parameter lets users trade off between geometric fidelity and output realism. Extensive quantitative evaluation and user studies demonstrate that SpaceControl outperforms both training-based and optimization-based baselines in geometric faithfulness while preserving high visual quality. Finally, we present an interactive user interface that enables online editing of superquadrics for direct conversion into textured 3D assets, facilitating practical deployment in creative workflows.

However, existing LLM-based RL methods often focus on the guidance of control policy and encounter the challenge of limited representations of the backbone networks. To tackle this problem, we introduce Enhanced Semantic Motion Representations (Semore), a new VLM-based framework for visual RL, which can simultaneously extract semantic and motion representations through a dual-path backbone from the RGB flows. Semore utilizes VLM with common-sense knowledge to retrieve key information from observations, while using the pre-trained clip to achieve the text-image alignment, thereby embedding the ground-truth representations into the backbone. To efficiently fuse semantic and motion representations for decision-making, our method adopts a separately supervised approach to simultaneously guide the extraction of semantics and motion, while allowing them to interact spontaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under the guidance of VLM at the feature level, our method exhibits efficient and adaptive ability compared to state-of-art methods. All codes are released.",

These domains demand conceptual understanding, symbolic reasoning, and adherence to formal laws, requirements that most existing benchmarks fail to address. In particular, current datasets tend to be static, lacking intermediate reasoning steps, robustness to variations, or mechanisms for verifying scientific correctness. To address these limitations, we introduce PRiSM, a synthetic, fully dynamic, and multimodal benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning via grounded Python code. PRiSM includes over 24,750 university-level physics and math problems, and it leverages our scalable agent-based pipeline, PrismAgent, to generate well-structured problem instances. Each problem contains dynamic textual and visual input, a generated figure, alongside rich structured outputs: executable Python code for ground truth generation and verification, and detailed step-by-step reasoning. The dynamic nature and Python-powered automated ground truth generation of our benchmark allow for fine-grained experimental auditing of multimodal VLMs, revealing failure modes, uncertainty behaviors, and limitations in scientific reasoning. To this end, we propose five targeted evaluation tasks covering generalization, symbolic program synthesis, perturbation robustness, reasoning correction, and ambiguity resolution.

Although attention-based pruning methods are widely used to accelerate inference, trials at early decoder layers often result in significant performance degradation, especially under high compression rates. We argue that while attention-based pruning inherently holds the potential to identify the most relevant visual tokens, its effectiveness in shallow decoder layers is limited by factors such as positional encoding bias and insufficient information interaction. In this paper, we propose an improved attention-based pruning framework, termed ShaRP, that integrates segment-aware causal masking, positional debiasing, and token deduplication for enhanced token selection. It enables effective pruning at shallow layers while maintaining stable performance under high compression rates without retraining.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2512.05927v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have led to significant breakthroughs in high-fidelity video synthesis, specifically in controllable video generation where the generated video is conditioned on text and action inputs, e.g., in instruction-guided video editing and world modeling in robotics. Despite these exceptional capabilities, controllable video models often hallucinate - generating future video frames that are misaligned with physical reality - which raises serious concerns in many tasks such as robot policy evaluation and planning. However, state-of-the-art video models lack the ability to assess and express their confidence, impeding hallucination mitigation. To rigorously address this challenge, we propose C3, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for training continuous-scale calibrated controllable video models for dense confidence estimation at the subpatch level, precisely localizing the uncertainty in each generated video frame. Our UQ method introduces three core innovations to empower video models to estimate their uncertainty. First, our method develops a novel framework that trains video models for correctness and calibration via strictly proper scoring rules. Second, we estimate the video model's uncertainty in latent space, avoiding training instability and prohibitive training costs associated with pixel-space approaches. Third, we map the dense latent-space uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level uncertainty in the RGB space for intuitive visualization, providing high-resolution uncertainty heatmaps that identify untrustworthy regions. Through extensive experiments on large-scale robot learning datasets (Bridge and DROID) and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that our method not only provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within the training distribution, but also enables effective out-of-distribution detection.",

It extracts features from variants VLM's layers in a \\textbf{Para}llel way for comprehensive information interaction and retains a flexible separation architecture to enhance generation in \\textbf{Uni}fied multimodal model. Concretely, visual features from all VLM's layers are fed in parallel into a Layer Integration Module (LIM), which efficiently integrates fine-grained details and semantic abstractions and provides the fused representation as a condition to the diffusion model. To further enhance performance, we reveal that these hierarchical layers respond unequally to different rewards in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Crucially, we design a Layer-wise Dynamic Adjustment Mechanism (LDAM) to facilitate multiple reward improvements that aligns the hierarchical properties of these layers using RL. Extensive experiments show ParaUni leverages complementary multi-layer features to substantially improve generation quality and shows strong potential for multiple reward advances during RL stages.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2512.05272v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scenes in the real world are often composed of several static and dynamic objects. Capturing their 4-dimensional structures, composition and spatio-temporal configuration in-the-wild, though extremely interesting, is equally hard. Therefore, existing works often focus on one object at a time, while relying on some category-specific parametric shape model for dynamic objects. This can lead to inconsistent scene configurations, in addition to being limited to the modeled object categories. We propose COM4D (Compositional 4D), a method that consistently and jointly predicts the structure and spatio-temporal configuration of 4D/3D objects using only static multi-object or dynamic single object supervision. We achieve this by a carefully designed training of spatial and temporal attentions on 2D video input. The training is disentangled into learning from object compositions on the one hand, and single object dynamics throughout the video on the other, thus completely avoiding reliance on 4D compositional training data. At inference time, our proposed attention mixing mechanism combines these independently learned attentions, without requiring any 4D composition examples. By alternating between spatial and temporal reasoning, COM4D reconstructs complete and persistent 4D scenes with multiple interacting objects directly from monocular videos. Furthermore, COM4D provides state-of-the-art results in existing separate problems of 4D object and composed 3D reconstruction despite being purely data-driven.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2512.05853v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are widely used in various fields due to their powerful cross-modal comprehension and generation capabilities. However, more modalities bring more vulnerabilities to being utilized for jailbreak attacks, which induces MLLMs to output harmful content. Due to the strong reasoning ability of MLLMs, previous jailbreak attacks try to explore reasoning safety risk in text modal, while similar threats have been largely overlooked in the visual modal. To fully evaluate potential safety risks in the visual reasoning task, we propose Visual Reasoning Sequential Attack (VRSA), which induces MLLMs to gradually externalize and aggregate complete harmful intent by decomposing the original harmful text into several sequentially related sub-images. In particular, to enhance the rationality of the scene in the image sequence, we propose Adaptive Scene Refinement to optimize the scene most relevant to the original harmful query. To ensure the semantic continuity of the generated image, we propose Semantic Coherent Completion to iteratively rewrite each sub-text combined with contextual information in this scene. In addition, we propose Text-Image Consistency Alignment to keep the semantical consistency. A series of experiments demonstrates that the VRSA can achieve a higher attack success rate compared with the state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods on both the open-source and closed-source MLLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude-4.5-Sonnet.",

Unlike human experts who primarily rely on key areas to arrive at a diagnosis, existing slide-level multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for pathology rely on heavy slide-level encoders that process thousands of patch features in a brute-force manner, resulting in excessive computational cost. In this work, we revisit the WSI-language modeling paradigm and show that tile-level features exhibit strong global and local redundancy, whereas only a small subset of tiles are truly task-relevant. Motivated by this observation, we introduce an efficient MLLM framework, called LoC-Path, that replaces the expensive slide-level encoder with redundancy-reducing modules. We first design a Sparse Token Merger (STM) and an MAE-pretrained resampler to remove local redundancy and compress globally redundant tile tokens into a compact slide-level representation set. We then propose a Cross-Attention Routing Adapter (CARA) and a Token Importance Scorer (TIS) to integrate the compressed visual representation with the language model in a computation-efficient manner.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2512.05145v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Effective judges of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are crucial for model development. Current methods for training VLM judges mainly rely on large-scale human preference annotations. However, such an approach is costly, and the annotations easily become obsolete as models rapidly improve. In this work, we present a framework to self-train a VLM judge model without any human preference annotations, using only self-synthesized data. Our method is iterative and has three stages: (1) generate diverse multimodal instruction-response pairs at varying quality levels, (2) generate reasoning traces and judgments for each pair, removing the ones that do not match our expected quality levels, and (3) training on correct judge answers and their reasoning traces. We evaluate the resulting judge on Multimodal RewardBench and VL-RewardBench across domains: correctness, preference, reasoning, safety, and visual question-answering. Our method improves a Llama-3.2-11B multimodal judge from 0.38 to 0.51 in overall accuracy on VL-RewardBench, often outperforming much larger models including Llama-3.2-90B, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with particularly strong gains in general, hallucination, and reasoning dimensions.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2512.05698v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unsupervised 3D object detection leverages heuristic algorithms to discover potential objects, offering a promising route to reduce annotation costs in autonomous driving. Existing approaches mainly generate pseudo labels and refine them through self-training iterations. However, these pseudo-labels are often incorrect at the beginning of training, resulting in misleading the optimization process. Moreover, effectively filtering and refining them remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose OWL for unsupervised 3D object detection by occupancy guided warm-up and large-model priors reasoning. OWL first employs an Occupancy Guided Warm-up (OGW) strategy to initialize the backbone weight with spatial perception capabilities, mitigating the interference of incorrect pseudo-labels on network convergence. Furthermore, OWL introduces an Instance-Cued Reasoning (ICR) module that leverages the prior knowledge of large models to assess pseudo-label quality, enabling precise filtering and refinement. Finally, we design a Weight-adapted Self-training (WAS) strategy to dynamically re-weight pseudo-labels, improving the performance through self-training. Extensive experiments on Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) and KITTI demonstrate that OWL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by over 15.0% mAP, revealing the effectiveness of our method.",

Existing approaches either rely on LiDAR or geometric priors to compensate for missing depth, or sacrifice efficiency to achieve competitive accuracy. We introduce LeAD-M3D, a monocular 3D detector that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time inference without extra modalities. Our method is powered by three key components. Asymmetric Augmentation Denoising Distillation (A2D2) transfers geometric knowledge from a clean-image teacher to a mixup-noised student via a quality- and importance-weighted depth-feature loss, enabling stronger depth reasoning without LiDAR supervision. 3D-aware Consistent Matching (CM3D) improves prediction-to-ground truth assignment by integrating 3D MGIoU into the matching score, yielding more stable and precise supervision. Finally, Confidence-Gated 3D Inference (CGI3D) accelerates detection by restricting expensive 3D regression to top-confidence regions.

We empirically observe there exists feature invariance in deterministic sampling, and present InvarDiff, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the relative temporal invariance across timestep-scale and layer-scale. From a few deterministic runs, we compute a per-timestep, per-layer, per-module binary cache plan matrix and use a re-sampling correction to avoid drift when consecutive caches occur. Using quantile-based change metrics, this matrix specifies which module at which step is reused rather than recomputed. The same invariance criterion is applied at the step scale to enable cross-timestep caching, deciding whether an entire step can reuse cached results. During inference, InvarDiff performs step-first and layer-wise caching guided by this matrix. When applied to DiT and FLUX, our approach reduces redundant compute while preserving fidelity. Experiments show that InvarDiff achieves $2$-$3\\times$ end-to-end speed-ups with minimal impact on standard quality metrics.

Our approach combines a lightweight U-Net transfer encoder with a diffusion-based generative model. The simpler U-Net is first pretrained on a long time series of coarse resolution data to learn spatiotemporal representations; its encoder is then frozen and transferred to a larger downscaling model as physically meaningful latent features. Our application uses NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis as the low resolution source domain (50 km) and the GEOS-5 Nature Run (G5NR) as the high resolution target (7 km). Our study area included a large area in Asia, which was made computationally tractable by splitting into two subregions and four seasons. We conducted domain similarity analysis using Wasserstein distances confirmed minimal distributional shift between MERRA-2 and G5NR, validating the safety of parameter frozen transfer. Across seasonal regional splits, our model achieved excellent performance (R2 = 0.65 to 0.94), outperforming comparison models including deterministic U-Nets, variational autoencoders, and prior transfer learning baselines. Out of data evaluations using semivariograms, ACF/PACF, and lag-based RMSE/R2 demonstrated that the predicted downscaled images preserved physically consistent spatial variability and temporal autocorrelation, enabling stable autoregressive reconstruction beyond the G5NR record. These results show that transfer enhanced diffusion models provide a robust and physically coherent solution for downscaling a long time series of coarse resolution images with limited training periods. This advancement has significant implications for improving environmental exposure assessment and long term environmental monitoring.",

This set forms a rank space made up of multiple individual ranks, whose expressiveness directly shapes the model's adaptability. However, quantitative analysis reveals low-rank adaptation exhibits significant redundancy in the rank space, with many ranks contributing almost no practical information. This hinders the model's ability to learn more diverse knowledge to address the various challenges in RGB-T tracking. To address this issue, we propose the Group Orthogonal Low-Rank Adaptation (GOLA) framework for RGB-T tracking, which effectively leverages the rank space through structured parameter learning. Specifically, we adopt a rank decomposition partitioning strategy utilizing singular value decomposition to quantify rank importance, freeze crucial ranks to preserve the pretrained priors, and cluster the redundant ranks into groups to prepare for subsequent orthogonal constraints. We further design an inter-group orthogonal constraint strategy. This constraint enforces orthogonality between rank groups, compelling them to learn complementary features that target diverse challenges, thereby alleviating information redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLA effectively reduces parameter redundancy and enhances feature representation capabilities, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets and validating its effectiveness in RGB-T tracking tasks.",

While recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) show substantial specific skills for a wide array of downstream tasks, they more or less fall shorts in general intelligence. Following correlation between intelligence and system 2 reasoning (slow thinking), in this paper, we aim to answering a worthwhile research question: could machine intelligence such as LLMs be evolved to acquire reasoning ability (not specific skill) just like our human beings? To this end, we propose evolutionary reasoning optimization (ERO) framework which performs survival of the fittest over a population of LLMs to search for individual with strong reasoning ability. Given a reasoning task, ERO first initializes multiple LLMs as a population, after which an evolutionary strategy evolves the population to maximize quantified reasoning score of the best individual. Based on experiments on representative testsuites, we claim two surprising empirical discoveries: i) the latest LLMs such as GPT-5 still show limited system 2 reasoning ability; ii) with simple evolution-loop of ERO, a relatively weak model (Qwen-7B) could be enhanced to emerge powerful reasoning ability.

We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\\bf Q}$ and ${\\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control. We demonstrate our framework on LLM summarization of corporate SEC 10-K filings.",

In this case, most existing video underwater enhancement methods are performed by directly applying the single-image enhancement model frame by frame, but a natural issue is lacking temporal consistency. To relieve the problem, we rethink the temporal manifold inherent in natural videos and observe a temporal consistency prior in dynamic scenes from the local temporal frequency perspective. Building upon the specific prior and no paired-data condition, we propose an implicit representation manner for enhanced video signals, which is conducted in the wavelet-based temporal consistency field, WaterWave. Specifically, under the constraints of the prior, we progressively filter and attenuate the inconsistent components while preserving motion details and scenes, achieving a natural-flowing video. Furthermore, to represent temporal frequency bands more accurately, an underwater flow correction module is designed to rectify estimated flows considering the transmission in underwater scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WaterWave significantly enhances the quality of videos generated using single-image underwater enhancements. Additionally, our method demonstrates high potential in downstream underwater tracking tasks, such as UOSTrack and MAT, outperforming the original video by a large margin, i.e., 19.7% and 9.7% on precise respectively.",

However, existing methods often struggle to generalize across different k-space undersampling patterns, requiring the training of a separate model for each specific pattern, which limits their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we propose UniFS, a Unified Frequency-Spatial Fusion model designed to handle multiple k-space undersampling patterns for MCMR tasks without any need for retraining. UniFS integrates three key modules: a Cross-Modal Frequency Fusion module, an Adaptive Mask-Based Prompt Learning module, and a Dual-Branch Complementary Refinement module. These modules work together to extract domain-invariant features from diverse k-space undersampling patterns while dynamically adapt to their own variations. Another limitation of existing MCMR methods is their tendency to focus solely on spatial information while neglect frequency characteristics, or extract only shallow frequency features, thus failing to fully leverage complementary cross-modal frequency information. To relieve this issue, UniFS introduces an adaptive prompt-guided frequency fusion module for k-space learning, significantly enhancing the model's generalization performance. We evaluate our model on the BraTS and HCP datasets with various k-space undersampling patterns and acceleration factors, including previously unseen patterns, to comprehensively assess UniFS's generalizability. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate that UniFS achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/LIKP0/UniFS.",

We introduce a self-supervised approach for detecting AI-generated images that leverages camera metadata -- specifically exchangeable image file format (EXIF) tags -- to learn features intrinsic to digital photography. Our pretext task trains a feature extractor solely on camera-captured photographs by classifying categorical EXIF tags (\\eg, camera model and scene type) and pairwise-ranking ordinal and continuous EXIF tags (\\eg, focal length and aperture value). Using these EXIF-induced features, we first perform one-class detection by modeling the distribution of photographic images with a Gaussian mixture model and flagging low-likelihood samples as AI-generated. We then extend to binary detection that treats the learned extractor as a strong regularizer for a classifier of the same architecture, operating on high-frequency residuals from spatially scrambled patches. Extensive experiments across various generative models demonstrate that our EXIF-induced detectors substantially advance the state of the art, delivering strong generalization to in-the-wild samples and robustness to common benign image perturbations.",

This setting is inherently challenging: source and target domains exhibit substantial distribution shifts, label spaces are disjoint, and support images are scarce--making standard episodic methods unreliable and computationally demanding at test time. To address these constraints, we propose DistillFSS, a framework that embeds support-set knowledge directly into a model's parameters through a teacher--student distillation process. By internalizing few-shot reasoning into a dedicated layer within the student network, DistillFSS eliminates the need for support images at test time, enabling fast, lightweight inference, while allowing efficient extension to novel classes in unseen domains through rapid teacher-driven specialization. Combined with fine-tuning, the approach scales efficiently to large support sets and significantly reduces computational overhead. To evaluate the framework under realistic conditions, we introduce a new CD-FSS benchmark spanning medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing, with disjoint label spaces and variable support sizes. Experiments show that DistillFSS matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in multi-class and multi-shot scenarios, while offering substantial efficiency gains.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2512.05415v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: One of the greatest challenges for detecting moving objects in the solar system from wide-field survey data is determining whether a signal indicates a true object or is due to some other source, like noise. Object verification has relied heavily on human eyes, which usually results in significant labor costs. In order to address this limitation and reduce the reliance on manual intervention, we propose a multi-input convolutional neural network integrated with a convolutional block attention module. This method is specifically tailored to enhance the moving object detection system that we have developed and used previously. The current method introduces two innovations. This first one is a multi-input architecture that processes multiple stacked images simultaneously. The second is the incorporation of the convolutional block attention module which enables the model to focus on essential features in both spatial and channel dimensions. These advancements facilitate efficient learning from multiple inputs, leading to more robust detection of moving objects. The performance of the model is evaluated on a dataset consisting of approximately 2,000 observational images. We achieved an accuracy of nearly 99% with AUC (an Area Under the Curve) of >0.99. These metrics indicate that the proposed model achieves excellent classification performance. By adjusting the threshold for object detection, the new model reduces the human workload by more than 99% compared to manual verification.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2512.05759v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D point cloud data often comes with high annotation costs. Active learning automates the process of selecting which data to annotate, reducing the total amount of annotation needed to achieve satisfactory performance. Recent approaches to active learning for 3D point clouds are often based on sophisticated heuristics for both, splitting point clouds into annotatable regions and selecting the most beneficial for further neural network training. In this work, we propose a novel and easy-to-implement strategy to separate the point cloud into annotatable regions. In our approach, we utilize a 2D grid to subdivide the point cloud into columns. To identify the next data to be annotated, we employ a network ensemble to estimate the uncertainty in the network output. We evaluate our method on the S3DIS dataset, the Toronto-3D dataset, and a large-scale urban 3D point cloud of the city of Freiburg, which we labeled in parts manually. The extensive evaluation shows that our method yields performance on par with, or even better than, complex state-of-the-art methods on all datasets. Furthermore, we provide results suggesting that in the context of point clouds the annotated area can be a more meaningful measure for active learning algorithms than the number of annotated points.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2512.05515v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) integrates various modalities, such as text, image, and audio, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of sentiment. However, effective MSA is challenged by alignment and fusion issues. Alignment requires synchronizing both temporal and semantic information across modalities, while fusion involves integrating these aligned features into a unified representation. Existing methods often address alignment or fusion in isolation, leading to limitations in performance and efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dual-stream Alignment with Hierarchical Bottleneck Fusion (DashFusion). Firstly, dual-stream alignment module synchronizes multimodal features through temporal and semantic alignment. Temporal alignment employs cross-modal attention to establish frame-level correspondences among multimodal sequences. Semantic alignment ensures consistency across the feature space through contrastive learning. Secondly, supervised contrastive learning leverages label information to refine the modality features. Finally, hierarchical bottleneck fusion progressively integrates multimodal information through compressed bottleneck tokens, which achieves a balance between performance and computational efficiency. We evaluate DashFusion on three datasets: CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS. Experimental results demonstrate that DashFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our alignment and fusion techniques.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2512.05937v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Common approaches to explainable AI (XAI) for deep learning focus on analyzing the importance of input features on the classification task in a given model: saliency methods like SHAP and GradCAM are used to measure the impact of spatial regions of the input image on the classification result. Combined with ground truth information about the location of the object in the input image (e.g., a binary mask), it is determined whether object pixels had a high impact on the classification result, or whether the classification focused on background pixels. The former is considered to be a sign of a healthy classifier, whereas the latter is assumed to suggest overfitting on spurious correlations. A major challenge, however, is that these intuitive interpretations are difficult to test quantitatively, and hence the output of such explanations lacks an explanation itself. One particular reason is that correlations in real-world data are difficult to avoid, and whether they are spurious or legitimate is debatable. Synthetic data in turn can facilitate to actively enable or disable correlations where desired but often lack a sufficient quantification of realism and stochastic properties. [...] Therefore, we systematically generate six synthetic datasets for the task of traffic sign recognition, which differ only in their degree of camera variation and background correlation [...] to quantify the isolated influence of background correlation, different levels of camera variation, and considered traffic sign shapes on the classification performance, as well as background feature importance. [...] Results include a quantification of when and how much background features gain importance to support the classification task based on changes in the training domain [...].

Experimental results demonstrate that our GA-optimized approach reduces Mean Squared Error by 42.86% while increasing Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Structural Similarity by 8.47% and 28.52%, respectively, compared with baseline configurations.
