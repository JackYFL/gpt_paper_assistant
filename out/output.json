        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.18678v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Spatial intelligence is emerging as a transformative frontier in AI, yet it remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. Unlike the abundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors and laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that converts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic 3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and pseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale calibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery and the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically generating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce data collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence. We release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can benefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based reasoning. These results validate our pipeline as an effective solution for developing AI systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting with physical environments.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.19280v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Remote sensing imagery presents vast, inherently unstructured spatial data, demanding sophisticated reasoning to interpret complex user intents and contextual relationships beyond simple recognition tasks. In this paper, we aim to construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by reasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it should be somewhat autonomous, where predefined ground-truth reasoning paths do not constrain the learning process. Furthermore, its architecture ought to be unified yet flexible, enabling the model to perform diverse reasoning tasks with distinct output formats through a single forward pass. Existing remote sensing approaches fail to address these requirements, as they rely on supervised fine-tuning paradigms that constrain the autonomy of reasoning. To this end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a flexible and robust workflow for remote sensing reasoning tasks. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing targets, together with task adaptation strategies that enable multi-granularity output generation. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient autonomy for precise reasoning. At the inference stage, our adaptation strategies enable diverse output formats at inference time without requiring task-specific decoders or further fine-tuning. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that RemoteReasoner achieves remarkable performance across multi-granularity reasoning tasks, including region-level and pixel-level. Additionally, our framework enables novel capabilities such as the contour extraction task beyond the reach of existing reasoning pipelines.",

It comprises four levels: GUI Content Understanding, Element Grounding, Task Automation, and Task Collaboration, covering essential skills for GUI agents. In addition, we propose a novel Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA) metric to assess GUI agent execution efficiency in online automation scenarios. Through MMBench-GUI, we identify accurate visual grounding as a critical determinant of overall task success, emphasizing the substantial benefits of modular frameworks that integrate specialized grounding modules. Furthermore, to achieve reliable GUI automation, an agent requires strong task planning and cross-platform generalization abilities, with long-context memory, a broad action space, and long-term reasoning playing a critical role. More important, task efficiency remains a critically underexplored dimension, and all models suffer from substantial inefficiencies, with excessive redundant steps even when tasks are ultimately completed. The integration of precise localization, effective planning, and early stopping strategies is indispensable to enable truly efficient and scalable GUI automation.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.18881v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Since a building's floorplans are easily accessible, consistent over time, and inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, self-localization within the floorplan has attracted researchers' interest. However, since floorplans are minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric differences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this task. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose filters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization errors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously shaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan Localization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric priors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we first model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints, i.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints between multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the view-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color correspondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB frames of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised contrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are required. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the modal gap while improving localization success without increasing the computational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy. All data and code will be released after the anonymous review.",

While recent advances have led to usable applications, existing benchmarks fail to account for the internal task heterogeneity and the corresponding agent capabilities, as well as their alignment with actual user demands-hindering both targeted capability development and the reliable transition of research progress into practical deployment. To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily computer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15 applications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and a generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy. To enable fine-grained analysis of required capabilities and alignment with real-world scenarios, OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation level across a five-level taxonomy, and generalization scope across a demand hierarchy. This design captures varying levels of required agent autonomy and generalization, forming a performance-generalization evaluation matrix for structured and comprehensive assessment. Experiments show that even State-of-the-Art agents with VLM backbones struggle with higher-level tasks involving perception, reasoning, and coordination-highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of current strengths and limitations to drive the future progress in computer-using agents research and deployment.

Unlike existing approaches that rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness. Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts (DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer (MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS 2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy, interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing modality scenarios at test time.",

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-Text, a large-scale and high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To construct the SAR-Text dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage progressive transfer learning strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks: image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA). Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT: SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and 10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores exceeding those of the original CoCa model by more than 8x, 4x, and 10x, respectively. In the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that, as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets.",

However, existing models and datasets predominantly neglect the influence of subjective cognitive diversity on fixation behavior. Conventional saliency prediction models, typically employing segmentation approaches, rely on low-resolution imagery to generate saliency heatmaps, subsequently upscaled to native resolutions, which limiting their capacity to capture personalized attention patterns. Furthermore, MLLMs are constrained by factors such as hallucinations, making it very costly to strictly adhere to the expected format in tasks involving multiple point predictions, and achieving precise point positioning is challenging. To address these limitations, we present Subjective Personalized Attention for Advertisement Videos, namely SPA-ADV, a large-scale multimodal dataset capturing gaze behaviors from over 4,500 participants varying in age and gender with 486 videos. Furthermore, we propose PRE-MAP, a novel eye-tracking saliency model that characterizes Personalized visual disparities through Reinforcement learning-optimized Eye-tracking, built upon MLLMs and guided by Multi-Attribute user profiles to predict Points. To ensure MLLMs produce prediction points that are both format-correct and spatially accurate, we introduce Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), inspired by the variability in eye movement points and Multi-Attribute profiles. Extensive experiments on SPA-ADV and other benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

However, the generated view sequences suffer from semantic drift issue derived from the accumulated deviation of the outpainting module. To tackle this challenge, we propose ScenePainter, a new framework for semantically consistent 3D scene generation, which aligns the outpainter's scene-specific prior with the comprehension of the current scene. To be specific, we introduce a hierarchical graph structure dubbed SceneConceptGraph to construct relations among multi-level scene concepts, which directs the outpainter for consistent novel views and can be dynamically refined to enhance diversity.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.19451v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric priors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground, and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes. It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy reconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception. Project Page: https://gs-occ3d.github.io/",

To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object detection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction. However, effective integration of these modalities for precise object detection task still remains a largely open problem. To address that, we propose a MultiStream Detection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information from both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its LiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input while the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features.

To address this, we propose a novel multi-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view sticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically, inspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple views, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by providing rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a hierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual understanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both global and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive learning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different stages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and local-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce a text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall multimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on 2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly outperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher accuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best pre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4% on F1 and 4.0% on accuracy. The code is released at https://github.com/cccccj-03/MGHFT_ACMMM2025.",

To address this issue, we design a novel evaluation score, ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score, that achieves and surpasses the objectives of text-image alignment by assessing the degree to which images represent textual content. Building upon this foundation, we further train an HP (High-Preference) score model using solely the image modality to enhance image aesthetics and detail quality while maintaining text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed evaluation model improves scoring accuracy by over 10\\% compared to existing methods, and achieves significant results in optimizing state-of-the-art text-to-image models.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.19253v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection for 2D objects has gained significant attention and achieved progress in anomaly detection (AD) methods. However, identifying 3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite explicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud backbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to adequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the disparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the scarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal scenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world abnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly detection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key aspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data simply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth and appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the flexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly Generator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies in RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data, effectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can directly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD and Eyecandies datasets.

To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a dynamic patch-based trajectory prediction framework that unifies time-domain and frequency-domain representations. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory into raw time sequences and frequency components, employing dynamic patch partitioning for multi-scale trajectory segmentation to capture hierarchical motion patterns. Each patch is processed by an adaptive embedding layer with scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of two branches interact via cross-modal attention, enabling complementary fusion of temporal and spectral cues.

Effectively querying this data is essential to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data, state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories, resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.",

While conventional methods require per-instance optimization, recent feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate 3D Gaussians with a learnable network. However, these methods predict Gaussians for each frame independently, without fully capturing the relations of Gaussians from different timestamps. To address this, we propose Human Gaussian Graph to model the connection between predicted Gaussians and human SMPL mesh, so that we can leverage information from all frames to recover an animatable human representation. Specifically, the Human Gaussian Graph contains dual layers where Gaussians are the first layer nodes and mesh vertices serve as the second layer nodes. Based on this structure, we further propose the intra-node operation to aggregate various Gaussians connected to one mesh vertex, and inter-node operation to support message passing among mesh node neighbors.

Specifically, many real-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or non-existent, \\eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific conditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale training, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation. To address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the scarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive data containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions demand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable widespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically observe that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the affirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related parameters during inference. In brief, NEAT can reduce distribution shift in consistent semantics while eliminating false distributional consistency in unrelated semantics.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.19360v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a foundational model in computer vision, excelling in generalization and adaptation to downstream tasks. However, deploying ViTs to support diverse resource constraints typically requires retraining multiple, size-specific ViTs, which is both time-consuming and energy-intensive. To address this issue, we propose an efficient ViT adaptation framework that enables a single adaptation process to generate multiple models of varying sizes for deployment on platforms with various resource constraints. Our approach comprises two stages. In the first stage, we enhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables structural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads, embedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and ensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that progressively increases elasticity. In the second stage, we design a lightweight router to select submodels according to computational budgets and downstream task demands. Initialized with Pareto-optimal configurations derived via a customized NSGA-II algorithm, the router is then jointly optimized with the backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of EA-ViT. The code is available at https://github.com/zcxcf/EA-ViT.",

However, traditional measures for hallucination and factuality are not well suited for evaluating longer, more diverse captions and in settings where ground-truth human-annotated captions are unavailable. We introduce OV-Fact, a novel method for measuring caption factuality of long captions that leverages open-vocabulary visual grounding and tool-based verification without depending on human annotations. Our method improves agreement with human judgments and captures both caption descriptiveness (recall) and factual precision in the same metric. Furthermore, unlike previous metrics, our reference-free method design enables new applications towards factuality-based data filtering. We observe models trained on an OVFact-filtered (2.5-5x less) subset of a large-scale, noisy (VLM-generated) pretraining set meaningfully improve factuality precision without sacrificing caption descriptiveness across a range of downstream long caption benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.19201v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mammography is the most commonly used imaging modality for breast cancer screening, driving an increasing demand for deep-learning techniques to support large-scale analysis. However, the development of accurate and robust methods is often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in lesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for data synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize lesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In this paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel framework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and localized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework, where the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that represents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical coherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize lesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that guides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most relevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing their interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise control over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of synthesized mammograms. These advancements position GCDM as a promising tool for clinical applications in mammogram synthesis. Our code is available at https://github.com/lixinHUST/Gated-Conditional-Diffusion-Model/",

While existing conditional diffusion models incrementally generate motions by conditioning on previously generated characters, they rely on single shared prompts, limiting nuanced control and leading to overly simplified interactions. In this paper, we introduce Person-Interaction Noise Optimization (PINO), a novel, training-free framework designed for generating realistic and customizable interactions among groups of arbitrary size. PINO decomposes complex group interactions into semantically relevant pairwise interactions, and leverages pretrained two-person interaction diffusion models to incrementally compose group interactions. To ensure physical plausibility and avoid common artifacts such as overlapping or penetration between characters, PINO employs physics-based penalties during noise optimization. This approach allows precise user control over character orientation, speed, and spatial relationships without additional training. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PINO generates visually realistic, physically coherent, and adaptable multi-person interactions suitable for diverse animation, gaming, and robotics applications.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.19140v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper studies the few-shot segmentation (FSS) task, which aims to segment objects belonging to unseen categories in a query image by learning a model on a small number of well-annotated support samples. Our analysis of two mainstream FSS paradigms reveals that the predictions made by prototype learning methods are usually conservative, while those of affinity learning methods tend to be more aggressive. This observation motivates us to balance the conservative and aggressive information captured by these two types of FSS frameworks so as to improve the segmentation performance. To achieve this, we propose a **P**rototype-**A**ffinity **H**ybrid **Net**work (PAHNet), which introduces a Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) module and an Attention Score Calibration (ASC) module in each attention block of an affinity learning model (called affinity learner). These two modules utilize the predictions generated by a pre-trained prototype learning model (called prototype predictor) to enhance the foreground information in support and query image representations and suppress the mismatched foreground-background (FG-BG) relationships between them, respectively. In this way, the aggressiveness of the affinity learner can be effectively mitigated, thereby eventually increasing the segmentation accuracy of our PAHNet method. Experimental results show that PAHNet outperforms most recently proposed methods across 1-shot and 5-shot settings on both PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, suggesting its effectiveness.

In this context, images are reconstructed from linearly compressed measurements. In practice, total variation minimisation is still used to reconstruct the image from noisy measurements of the inner product between orthogonal sampling pattern vectors and the original image data. However, data can be leveraged to learn the measurement vectors and the reconstruction process, thereby enhancing compression, reconstruction quality, and speed. We train an autoencoder through self-supervision to learn an encoder (or measurement matrix) and a decoder. We then test it on physically acquired multispectral and intensity data. During acquisition, the learned encoder becomes part of the physical device. Our approach can enhance single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy by reducing reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude, achieving superior image quality, and enabling multispectral reconstructions. Ultimately, learned single-pixel fluorescence microscopy could advance diagnosis and biological research, providing multispectral imaging at a fraction of the cost.",

For a given uniform-bit quantization configuration, MixA-Q separates the batched window computations within Swin blocks and assigns a lower bit width to the activations of less important windows, improving the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We introduce a Two-Branch Swin Block that processes activations separately in high- and low-bit precision, enabling seamless integration of our method with most quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ) methods, or with simple modifications. Our experimental evaluations over the COCO dataset demonstrate that MixA-Q achieves a training-free 1.35x computational speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ configuration. With QAT, MixA-Q achieves a lossless 1.25x speedup and a 1.53x speedup with only a 1% mAP drop by incorporating activation pruning. Notably, by reducing the quantization error in important regions, our sparsity-aware quantization adaptation improves the mAP of the quantized W4A4 model (with both weights and activations in 4-bit precision) by 0.7%, reducing quantization degradation by 24%.",

While universal lesion segmentation models have advanced, they are typically designed for single time points. This paper investigates the performance of the ULS23 segmentation model in a longitudinal context. Using a public clinical dataset of baseline and follow-up CT scans, we evaluated the model's ability to segment and track lesions over time. We identified two critical, interconnected failure modes: a sharp degradation in segmentation quality in follow-up cases due to inter-scan registration errors, and a subsequent breakdown of the lesion correspondence process. To systematically probe this vulnerability, we conducted a controlled experiment where we artificially displaced the input volume relative to the true lesion center. Our results demonstrate that the model's performance is highly dependent on its assumption of a centered lesion; segmentation accuracy collapses when the lesion is sufficiently displaced. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation of applying single-timepoint models to longitudinal data. We conclude that robust oncological tracking requires a paradigm shift away from cascading single-purpose tools towards integrated, end-to-end models inherently designed for temporal analysis.",

The second part surveys emerging applications of LLMs in multi-agent simulation frameworks, focusing on system architectures, scale, and validation strategies. Notable projects such as Generative Agents (Smallville) and AgentSociety are discussed in terms of their design choices, empirical grounding, and methodological innovations. Particular attention is given to the challenges of behavioral fidelity, calibration, and reproducibility in large-scale LLM-driven simulations. The final section distinguishes between contexts where LLMs, like other black-box systems, offer direct value-such as interactive simulations and serious games-and those where their use is more problematic, notably in explanatory or predictive modeling.

Despite shared architecture and learning frameworks, they prioritize different goals: generation seeks high perceptual quality and diversity, while reconstruction focuses on data fidelity and faithfulness. In this work, we introduce a \"generative model zoo\" and systematically analyze how modern latent diffusion models and autoregressive models navigate the reconstruction-generation spectrum. We benchmark a suite of generative models across representative cardiac medical imaging tasks, focusing on image inpainting with varying masking ratios and sampling strategies, as well as unconditional image generation.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.18944v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Given an object mask, Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (SVOS) technique aims to track and segment the object across video frames, serving as a fundamental task in computer vision. Although recent memory-based methods demonstrate potential, they often struggle with scenes involving occlusion, particularly in handling object interactions and high feature similarity. To address these issues and meet the real-time processing requirements of downstream applications, in this paper, we propose a novel bOundary Amendment video object Segmentation method with Inherent Structure refinement, hereby named OASIS. Specifically, a lightweight structure refinement module is proposed to enhance segmentation accuracy. With the fusion of rough edge priors captured by the Canny filter and stored object features, the module can generate an object-level structure map and refine the representations by highlighting boundary features. Evidential learning for uncertainty estimation is introduced to further address challenges in occluded regions. The proposed method, OASIS, maintains an efficient design, yet extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate its superior performance and competitive inference speed compared to other state-of-the-art methods, i.e., achieving the F values of 91.6 (vs. 89.7 on DAVIS-17 validation set) and G values of 86.6 (vs. 86.2 on YouTubeVOS 2019 validation set) while maintaining a competitive speed of 48 FPS on DAVIS.",

        "title": "A Self-training Framework for Semi-supervised Pulmonary Vessel Segmentation and Its Application in COPD",
        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.19074v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Background: It is fundamental for accurate segmentation and quantification of the pulmonary vessel, particularly smaller vessels, from computed tomography (CT) images in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Objective: The aim of this study was to segment the pulmonary vasculature using a semi-supervised method. Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is proposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of pulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the in-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the semi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of labeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher model is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which reliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the student model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is iteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results: Extensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD patients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed method, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by 2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is conducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the differences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease. Conclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of pulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis. The code will be made available at https://github.com/wuyanan513/semi-supervised-learning-for-vessel-segmentation.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.18925v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Object detection (OD) in infrared (IR) imagery is critical for low-light and nighttime applications. However, the scarcity of large-scale IR datasets forces models to rely on weights pre-trained on RGB images. While fine-tuning on IR improves accuracy, it often compromises robustness under distribution shifts due to the inherent modality gap between RGB and IR. To address this, we introduce LLVIP-C and FLIR-C, two cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks built by applying corruption to standard IR datasets. Additionally, to fully leverage the complementary knowledge from RGB and infrared trained models, we propose WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants: WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$, which combines RGB zero-shot and IR fine-tuned weights, and WiSE-OD$_{LP}$, which blends zero-shot and linear probing. Evaluated across three RGB-pretrained detectors and two robust baselines, WiSE-OD improves both cross-modality and corruption robustness without any additional training or inference cost.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.18870v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Studying adversarial attacks on point clouds is essential for evaluating and improving the robustness of 3D deep learning models. However, most existing attack methods are developed under ideal white-box settings and often suffer from limited transferability to unseen models and insufficient robustness against common defense mechanisms. In this paper, we propose MAT-Adv, a novel adversarial attack framework that enhances both transferability and undefendability by explicitly perturbing the medial axis transform (MAT) representations, in order to induce inherent adversarialness in the resulting point clouds. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point clouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric structure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations, MAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain effective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting and prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the optimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and undefendability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAT-Adv significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both transferability and undefendability. Codes will be made public upon paper acceptance.",

        "title": "Towards Improving Long-Tail Entity Predictions in Temporal Knowledge Graphs through Global Similarity and Weighted Sampling",
        "abstract": "arXiv:2507.18977v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) completion models traditionally assume access to the entire graph during training. This overlooks challenges stemming from the evolving nature of TKGs, such as: (i) the model's requirement to generalize and assimilate new knowledge, and (ii) the task of managing new or unseen entities that often have sparse connections. In this paper, we present an incremental training framework specifically designed for TKGs, aiming to address entities that are either not observed during training or have sparse connections. Our approach combines a model-agnostic enhancement layer with a weighted sampling strategy, that can be augmented to and improve any existing TKG completion method. The enhancement layer leverages a broader, global definition of entity similarity, which moves beyond mere local neighborhood proximity of GNN-based methods. The weighted sampling strategy employed in training accentuates edges linked to infrequently occurring entities. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in total link prediction, inductive link prediction, and in addressing long-tail entities. Notably, our method achieves a 10\\% improvement and a 15\\% boost in MRR for these datasets. The results underscore the potential of our approach in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and enhancing the robustness of TKG completion methods, especially in an incremental training context",
