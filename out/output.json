        "title": "Unleashing MLLMs on the Edge: A Unified Framework for Cross-Modal ReID via Adaptive SVD Distillation",
        "abstract": "arXiv:2602.12936v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Practical cloud-edge deployment of Cross-Modal Re-identification (CM-ReID) faces challenges due to maintaining a fragmented ecosystem of specialized cloud models for diverse modalities. While Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong unification potential, existing approaches fail to adapt them into a single end-to-end backbone and lack effective knowledge distillation strategies for edge deployment. To address these limitations, we propose MLLMEmbed-ReID, a unified framework based on a powerful cloud-edge architecture. First, we adapt a foundational MLLM into a state-of-the-art cloud model. We leverage instruction-based prompting to guide the MLLM in generating a unified embedding space across RGB, infrared, sketch, and text modalities. This model is then trained efficiently with a hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation finetuning (LoRA-SFT) strategy, optimized under a holistic cross-modal alignment objective. Second, to deploy its knowledge onto an edge-native student, we introduce a novel distillation strategy motivated by the low-rank property in the teacher's feature space. To prioritize essential information, this method employs a Principal Component Mapping loss, while relational structures are preserved via a Feature Relation loss. Our lightweight edge-based model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple visual CM-ReID benchmarks, while its cloud-based counterpart excels across all CM-ReID benchmarks. The MLLMEmbed-ReID framework thus presents a complete and effective solution for deploying unified MLLM-level intelligence on resource-constrained devices. The code and models will be open-sourced soon.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2602.12618v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) incur significant computational cost from processing numerous vision tokens through all LLM layers. Prior pruning methods operate either before the LLM, limiting generality due to diverse encoder-projector designs or within the LLM using heuristics that are incompatible with FlashAttention. We take a different approach: rather than identifying unimportant tokens, we treat the LLM itself as the optimal guide for compression. Observing that deeper layers naturally transmit vision-to-text information, we introduce Attention-Driven Self-Compression (ADSC), a simple, broadly applicable method that progressively reduces vision tokens using only the LLM's attention mechanism. Our method applies uniform token downsampling at selected layers, forming bottlenecks that encourage the model to reorganize and compress information into the remaining tokens. It requires no score computation, auxiliary modules, or attention modification, and remains fully compatible with FlashAttention. Applied to LLaVA-1.5, ADSC reduces FLOPs by 53.7% and peak KV-cache memory by 56.7%, while preserving 98.2% of the original model performance. Across multiple benchmarks, it outperforms prior pruning approaches in both efficiency and accuracy. Crucially, under high compression ratios, our method remains robust while heuristic-based techniques degrade sharply.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2602.12774v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Object counting is a fundamental task in computer vision, with broad applicability in many real-world scenarios. Fully-supervised counting methods require costly point-level annotations per object. Few weakly-supervised methods leverage only image-level object counts as supervision and achieve fairly promising results. They are, however, often limited to counting a single category, e.g. person. In this paper, we propose WS-COC, the first MLLM-driven weakly-supervised framework for class-agnostic object counting. Instead of directly fine-tuning MLLMs to predict object counts, which can be challenging due to the modality gap, we incorporate three simple yet effective strategies to bootstrap the counting paradigm in both training and testing: First, a divide-and-discern dialogue tuning strategy is proposed to guide the MLLM to determine whether the object count falls within a specific range and progressively break down the range through multi-round dialogue. Second, a compare-and-rank count optimization strategy is introduced to train the MLLM to optimize the relative ranking of multiple images according to their object counts. Third, a global-and-local counting enhancement strategy aggregates and fuses local and global count predictions to improve counting performance in dense scenes. Extensive experiments on FSC-147, CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech show that WS-COC matches or even surpasses many state-of-art fully-supervised methods while significantly reducing annotation costs.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2602.12919v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Event stream-based Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is an emerging research direction that offers a compelling solution to the instability of conventional visible-light cameras under challenging conditions such as low illumination, overexposure, and high-speed motion. Recognizing the current scarcity of dedicated datasets in this domain, we introduce EPRBench, a high-quality benchmark specifically designed for event stream-based VPR. EPRBench comprises 10K event sequences and 65K event frames, collected using both handheld and vehicle-mounted setups to comprehensively capture real-world challenges across diverse viewpoints, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios. To support semantic-aware and language-integrated VPR research, we provide LLM-generated scene descriptions, subsequently refined through human annotation, establishing a solid foundation for integrating LLMs into event-based perception pipelines. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we implement and benchmark 15 state-of-the-art VPR algorithms on EPRBench, offering a strong baseline for future algorithmic comparisons. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion paradigm for VPR: leveraging LLMs to generate textual scene descriptions from raw event streams, which then guide spatially attentive token selection, cross-modal feature fusion, and multi-scale representation learning. This framework not only achieves highly accurate place recognition but also produces interpretable reasoning processes alongside its predictions, significantly enhancing model transparency and explainability.

However, existing benchmarks for multimodal browsing remain limited in task complexity, evidence accessibility, and evaluation granularity, hindering comprehensive and reproducible assessments of deep search capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce BrowseComp-$V^3$, a novel benchmark consisting of 300 carefully curated and challenging questions spanning diverse domains. The benchmark emphasizes deep, multi-level, and cross-modal multi-hop reasoning, where critical evidence is interleaved across textual and visual modalities within and across web pages. All supporting evidence is strictly required to be publicly searchable, ensuring fairness and reproducibility. Beyond final-answer accuracy, we incorporate an expert-validated, subgoal-driven process evaluation mechanism that enables fine-grained analysis of intermediate reasoning behaviors and systematic characterization of capability boundaries. In addition, we propose OmniSeeker, a unified multimodal browsing agent framework integrating diverse web search and visual perception tools. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models achieve only 36% accuracy on our benchmark, revealing critical bottlenecks in multimodal information integration and fine-grained perception. Our results highlight a fundamental gap between current model capabilities and robust multimodal deep search in real-world settings.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2602.12843v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Radiological diagnosis is a perceptual process in which careful visual inspection and language reasoning are repeatedly interleaved. Most medical large vision language models (LVLMs) perform visual inspection only once and then rely on text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which operates purely in the linguistic space and is prone to hallucination. Recent methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing visually related coordinates, such as bounding boxes. However, these remain a pseudo-visual solution: coordinates are still text and fail to preserve rich visual details like texture and density. Motivated by the interleaved nature of radiological diagnosis, we introduce MMRad-IVL-22K, the first large-scale dataset designed for natively interleaved visual language reasoning in chest X-ray interpretation. MMRad-IVL-22K reflects a repeated cycle of reasoning and visual inspection workflow of radiologists, in which visual rationales complement textual descriptions and ground each step of the reasoning process. MMRad-IVL-22K comprises 21,994 diagnostic traces, enabling systematic scanning across 35 anatomical regions. Experimental results on advanced closed-source LVLMs demonstrate that report generation guided by multimodal CoT significantly outperforms that guided by text-only CoT in clinical accuracy and report quality (e.g., 6\\% increase in the RadGraph metric), confirming that high-fidelity interleaved vision language evidence is a non-substitutable component of reliable medical AI. Furthermore, benchmarking across seven state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs demonstrates that models fine-tuned on MMRad-IVL-22K achieve superior reasoning consistency and report quality compared with both general-purpose and medical-specific LVLMs. The project page is available at https://github.com/qiuzyc/thinking_like_a_radiologist.",

Intrapartum biometry plays a critical role in monitoring labor progression; however, the routine use of ultrasound in resource-limited settings is hindered by a shortage of trained sonographers. To address this challenge, the Intrapartum Ultrasound Grand Challenge (IUGC), co-hosted with MICCAI 2024, was launched. The IUGC introduces a clinically oriented multi-task automatic measurement framework that integrates standard plane classification, fetal head-pubic symphysis segmentation, and biometry, enabling algorithms to exploit complementary task information for more accurate estimation. Furthermore, the challenge releases the largest multi-center intrapartum ultrasound video dataset to date, comprising 774 videos (68,106 frames) collected from three hospitals, providing a robust foundation for model training and evaluation. In this study, we present a comprehensive overview of the challenge design, review the submissions from eight participating teams, and analyze their methods from five perspectives: preprocessing, data augmentation, learning strategy, model architecture, and post-processing. In addition, we perform a systematic analysis of the benchmark results to identify key bottlenecks, explore potential solutions, and highlight open challenges for future research. Although encouraging performance has been achieved, our findings indicate that the field remains at an early stage, and further in-depth investigation is required before large-scale clinical deployment. All benchmark solutions and the complete dataset have been publicly released to facilitate reproducible research and promote continued advances in automatic intrapartum ultrasound biometry.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2602.13020v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unsupervised image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision. It enables dense scene understanding without human annotations, which is especially valuable in domains where labelled data is scarce. However, existing methods often struggle to reconcile global semantic structure with fine-grained boundary accuracy. This paper introduces DynaGuide, an adaptive segmentation framework that addresses these challenges through a novel dual-guidance strategy and dynamic loss optimization. Building on our previous work, DynaSeg, DynaGuide combines global pseudo-labels from zero-shot models such as DiffSeg or SegFormer with local boundary refinement using a lightweight CNN trained from scratch. This synergy allows the model to correct coarse or noisy global predictions and produce high-precision segmentations. At the heart of DynaGuide is a multi-component loss that dynamically balances feature similarity, Huber-smoothed spatial continuity, including diagonal relationships, and semantic alignment with the global pseudo-labels. Unlike prior approaches, DynaGuide trains entirely without ground-truth labels in the target domain and supports plug-and-play integration of diverse guidance sources. Extensive experiments on BSD500, PASCAL VOC2012, and COCO demonstrate that DynaGuide achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving mIoU by 17.5% on BSD500, 3.1% on PASCAL VOC2012, and 11.66% on COCO.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2602.12461v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent studies have shown that CLIP model's adversarial robustness in zero-shot classification tasks can be enhanced by adversarially fine-tuning its image encoder with adversarial examples (AEs), which are generated by minimizing the cosine similarity between images and a hand-crafted template (e.g., ''A photo of a {label}''). However, it has been shown that the cosine similarity between a single image and a single hand-crafted template is insufficient to measure the similarity for image-text pairs. Building on this, in this paper, we find that the AEs generated using cosine similarity may fail to fool CLIP when the similarity metric is replaced with semantically enriched alternatives, making the image encoder fine-tuned with these AEs less robust. To overcome this issue, we first propose a semantic-ensemble attack to generate semantic-aware AEs by minimizing the average similarity between the original image and an ensemble of refined textual descriptions. These descriptions are initially generated by a foundation model to capture core semantic features beyond hand-crafted templates and are then refined to reduce hallucinations. To this end, we propose Semantic-aware Adversarial Fine-Tuning (SAFT), which fine-tunes CLIP's image encoder with semantic-aware AEs. Extensive experiments show that SAFT outperforms current methods, achieving substantial improvements in zero-shot adversarial robustness across 16 datasets.

In this paper, we identify spurious visual semantic correlations in existing generative ZSL worsened by scarce seen class samples and introduce two metrics to quantify spuriousness for seen and unseen classes. Furthermore, we point out a more critical bottleneck: existing unadaptive fully noised generators produce features disconnected from real test samples, which also leads to the spurious correlation. To enhance the visual-semantic correlations on both seen and unseen classes, we propose ZeroDiff++, a diffusion-based generative framework. In training, ZeroDiff++ uses (i) diffusion augmentation to produce diverse noised samples, (ii) supervised contrastive (SC) representations for instance level semantics, and (iii) multi view discriminators with Wasserstein mutual learning to assess generated features. At generation time, we introduce (iv) Diffusion-based Test time Adaptation (DiffTTA) to adapt the generator using pseudo label reconstruction, and (v) Diffusion-based Test time Generation (DiffGen) to trace the diffusion denoising path and produce partially synthesized features that connect real and generated data, and mitigates data scarcity further.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2602.12957v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Document parsing is a fundamental task in multimodal understanding, supporting a wide range of downstream applications such as information extraction and intelligent document analysis. Benefiting from strong semantic modeling and robust generalization, VLM-based end-to-end approaches have emerged as the mainstream paradigm in recent years. However, these models often suffer from substantial inference latency, as they must auto-regressively generate long token sequences when processing long-form documents. In this work, motivated by the extremely long outputs and complex layout structures commonly found in document parsing, we propose a training-free and highly efficient acceleration method. Inspired by speculative decoding, we employ a lightweight document parsing pipeline as a draft model to predict batches of future tokens, while the more accurate VLM verifies these draft predictions in parallel. Moreover, we further exploit the layout-structured nature of documents by partitioning each page into independent regions, enabling parallel decoding of each region using the same draft-verify strategy. The final predictions are then assembled according to the natural reading order. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: on the general-purpose OmniDocBench, our method provides a 2.42x lossless acceleration for the dots.ocr model, and achieves up to 4.89x acceleration on long-document parsing tasks. We will release our code to facilitate reproducibility and future research.",

Existing fairness-aware datasets have significantly improved demographic balance across global race and gender groups, yet they continue to treat Indian as a single monolithic category. The oversimplification ignores the vast intra-national diversity across 28 states and 8 Union Territories of India and leads to representational and geographical bias. To address the limitation, we present IndicFairFace, a novel and balanced face dataset comprising 14,400 images representing geographical diversity of India. Images were sourced ethically from Wikimedia Commons and open-license web repositories and uniformly balanced across states and gender. Using IndicFairFace, we quantify intra-national geographical bias in prominent CLIP-based VLMs and reduce it using post-hoc Iterative Nullspace Projection debiasing approach. We also show that the adopted debiasing approach does not adversely impact the existing embedding space as the average drop in retrieval accuracy on benchmark datasets is less than 1.5 percent.

However, recent studies reveal that joint learning often overfits certain modalities while neglecting others, leading to performance inferior to that of unimodal learning. Although previous efforts have sought to balance modal contributions or combine joint and unimodal learning, thereby mitigating the degradation of weaker modalities with promising outcomes, few have examined the relationship between joint and unimodal learning from an information-theoretic perspective. In this paper, we theoretically analyze modality competition and propose a method for multimodal classification by maximizing the total correlation between multimodal features and labels. By maximizing this objective, our approach alleviates modality competition while capturing inter-modal interactions via feature alignment. Building on Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE), we introduce Total Correlation Neural Estimation (TCNE) to derive a lower bound for total correlation. Subsequently, we present TCMax, a hyperparameter-free loss function that maximizes total correlation through variational bound optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCMax outperforms state-of-the-art joint and unimodal learning approaches. Our code is available at https://github.com/hubaak/TCMax.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2602.13055v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an effective and efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, neither RLHF nor DPO take into account the fact that learning certain preferences is more difficult than learning other preferences, rendering the optimization process suboptimal. To address this gap in text-to-image generation, we recently proposed Curriculum-DPO, a method that organizes image pairs by difficulty. In this paper, we introduce Curriculum-DPO++, an enhanced method that combines the original data-level curriculum with a novel model-level curriculum. More precisely, we propose to dynamically increase the learning capacity of the denoising network as training advances. We implement this capacity increase via two mechanisms. First, we initialize the model with only a subset of the trainable layers used in the original Curriculum-DPO. As training progresses, we sequentially unfreeze layers until the configuration matches the full baseline architecture. Second, as the fine-tuning is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we implement a progressive schedule for the dimension of the low-rank matrices. Instead of maintaining a fixed capacity, we initialize the low-rank matrices with a dimension significantly smaller than that of the baseline. As training proceeds, we incrementally increase their rank, allowing the capacity to grow until it converges to the same rank value as in Curriculum-DPO. Furthermore, we propose an alternative ranking strategy to the one employed by Curriculum-DPO. Finally, we compare Curriculum-DPO++ against Curriculum-DPO and other state-of-the-art preference optimization approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

Continued training on these refined trajectories enables the agent to evolve toward more efficient search patterns and reduces tool-call rounds by about 20% while improving accuracy.

Anomaly detection is typically formulated as a one-class classification problem, where the training data consists solely of nominal values, leaving methods built on this assumption susceptible to training label noise. We present a dataset folding method that transforms an arbitrary one-class classifier-based anomaly detector into a fully unsupervised method. This is achieved by making a set of key weak assumptions: that anomalies are uncommon in the training dataset and generally heterogeneous. These assumptions enable us to utilize multiple independently trained instances of a one-class classifier to filter the training dataset for anomalies. This transformation requires no modifications to the underlying anomaly detector; the only changes are algorithmically selected data subsets used for training. We demonstrate that our method can transform a wide variety of one-class classifier anomaly detectors for both images and videos into unsupervised ones. Our method creates the first unsupervised logical anomaly detectors by transforming existing methods. We also demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised anomaly detection on the MVTec AD, ViSA, and MVTec Loco AD datasets.

However, current agents typically rely on fixed cognitive patterns: non-thinking models generate immediate responses, while thinking models engage in deep reasoning uniformly. This rigidity is inefficient for long-horizon tasks, where cognitive demands vary significantly from step to step, with some requiring strategic planning and others only routine execution. In this paper, we introduce CogRouter, a framework that trains agents to dynamically adapt cognitive depth at each step. Grounded in ACT-R theory, we design four hierarchical cognitive levels ranging from instinctive responses to strategic planning. Our two-stage training approach includes Cognition-aware Supervised Fine-tuning (CoSFT) to instill stable level-specific patterns, and Cognition-aware Policy Optimization (CoPO) for step-level credit assignment via confidence-aware advantage reweighting. The key insight is that appropriate cognitive depth should maximize the confidence of the resulting action. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld demonstrate that CogRouter achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior efficiency.

Deployed tracking systems usually lack formal safety assurances to convey when tracking is reliable and when it may fail, at best relying on heuristic measures of model confidence to raise alerts. To obtain such assurances we propose interpreting object tracking as a sequential hypothesis test, wherein evidence for or against tracking failures is gradually accumulated over time. Leveraging recent advancements in the field, our sequential test (formalized as an e-process) quickly identifies when tracking failures set in whilst provably containing false alerts at a desired rate, and thus limiting potentially costly re-calibration or intervention steps. The approach is computationally light-weight, requires no extra training or fine-tuning, and is in principle model-agnostic. We propose both supervised and unsupervised variants by leveraging either ground-truth or solely internal tracking information, and demonstrate its effectiveness for two established tracking models across four video benchmarks. As such, sequential testing can offer a statistically grounded and efficient mechanism to incorporate safety assurances into real-time tracking systems.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2602.13067v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach, Spectral-Interpretable and -Enhanced Transformer (SIEFormer), which leverages spectral analysis to reinterpret the attention mechanism within Vision Transformer (ViT) and enhance feature adaptability, with particular emphasis on challenging Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) tasks. The proposed SIEFormer is composed of two main branches, each corresponding to an implicit and explicit spectral perspective of the ViT, enabling joint optimization. The implicit branch realizes the use of different types of graph Laplacians to model the local structure correlations of tokens, along with a novel Band-adaptive Filter (BaF) layer that can flexibly perform both band-pass and band-reject filtering. The explicit branch, on the other hand, introduces a Maneuverable Filtering Layer (MFL) that learns global dependencies among tokens by applying the Fourier transform to the input ``value\" features, modulating the transformed signal with a set of learnable parameters in the frequency domain, and then performing an inverse Fourier transform to obtain the enhanced features. Extensive experiments reveal state-of-the-art performance on multiple image recognition datasets, reaffirming the superiority of our approach through ablation studies and visualizations.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2602.13168v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the advancement of face recognition (FR) systems, privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) systems have gained popularity for their accurate recognition, enhanced facial privacy protection, and robustness to various attacks. However, there are limited studies to further verify privacy risks by reconstructing realistic high-resolution face images from embeddings of these systems, especially for PPFR. In this work, we propose the face embedding mapping (FEM), a general framework that explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for conducting the embedding-to-face attack by leveraging pre-trained Identity-Preserving diffusion model against state-of-the-art (SOTA) FR and PPFR systems. Based on extensive experiments, we verify that reconstructed faces can be used for accessing other real-word FR systems. Besides, the proposed method shows the robustness in reconstructing faces from the partial and protected face embeddings. Moreover, FEM can be utilized as a tool for evaluating safety of FR and PPFR systems in terms of privacy leakage. All images used in this work are from public datasets.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2602.12679v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent progress in image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models has significantly advanced the field of generative inbetweening, which aims to generate semantically plausible frames between two keyframes. In particular, inference-time sampling strategies, which leverage the generative priors of large-scale pre-trained I2V models without additional training, have become increasingly popular. However, existing inference-time sampling, either fusing forward and backward paths in parallel or alternating them sequentially, often suffers from temporal discontinuities and undesirable visual artifacts due to the misalignment between the two generated paths. This is because each path follows the motion prior induced by its own conditioning frame. In this work, we propose Motion Prior Distillation (MPD), a simple yet effective inference-time distillation technique that suppresses bidirectional mismatch by distilling the motion residual of the forward path into the backward path. Our method can deliberately avoid denoising the end-conditioned path which causes the ambiguity of the path, and yield more temporally coherent inbetweening results with the forward motion prior. We not only perform quantitative evaluations on standard benchmarks, but also conduct extensive user studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in practical scenarios.",

We evaluate nine frontier reasoning models under adversarial attacks. Our findings reveal that reasoning confers meaningful but incomplete robustness: most reasoning models studied significantly outperform instruction-tuned baselines, yet all exhibit distinct vulnerability profiles, with misleading suggestions universally effective and social pressure showing model-specific efficacy. Through trajectory analysis, we identify five failure modes (Self-Doubt, Social Conformity, Suggestion Hijacking, Emotional Susceptibility, and Reasoning Fatigue) with the first two accounting for 50% of failures. We further demonstrate that Confidence-Aware Response Generation (CARG), effective for standard LLMs, fails for reasoning models due to overconfidence induced by extended reasoning traces; counterintuitively, random confidence embedding outperforms targeted extraction. Our results highlight that reasoning capabilities do not automatically confer adversarial robustness and that confidence-based defenses require fundamental redesign for reasoning models.",

We introduce a diagnostic benchmark for 2-SAT built from parameterized families of structured 2--CNF formulas, where satisfiability is characterized by the implication graph and can be tuned along interpretable axes. Our generators isolate distinct competencies and failure modes: (i) contradiction-cycle UNSAT cores with controllable size and imbalance, (ii) SAT instances with a prescribed fraction of free variables to control solution multiplicity, (iii) planted backbones that modulate propagation, (iv) late bridge clauses that couple otherwise monotone regions to probe sensitivity to ordering and revision, and (v) symmetry/duplication variants that test abstraction under renaming and redundant structure. We evaluate LLM-based reasoners on decision accuracy and assignment validity, and quantify robustness under semantics-preserving perturbations such as clause reordering, filler clauses, and variable renaming. Across models, we observe sharp performance transitions under targeted structural interventions even when surface statistics are held fixed, revealing brittleness regimes that are invisible to aggregate SAT accuracy.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2602.13176v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To validate a clinically accessible approach for quantifying the Upper Extremity Reachable Workspace (UERW) using a single (monocular) camera and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven Markerless Motion Capture (MMC) for biomechanical analysis. Objective assessment and validation of these techniques for specific clinically oriented tasks are crucial for their adoption in clinical motion analysis. AI-driven monocular MMC reduces the barriers to adoption in the clinic and has the potential to reduce the overhead for analysis of this common clinical assessment. Nine adult participants with no impairments performed the standardized UERW task, which entails reaching targets distributed across a virtual sphere centered on the torso, with targets displayed in a VR headset. Movements were simultaneously captured using a marker-based motion capture system and a set of eight FLIR cameras. We performed monocular video analysis on two of these video camera views to compare a frontal and offset camera configurations. The frontal camera orientation demonstrated strong agreement with the marker-based reference, exhibiting a minimal mean bias of $0.61 \\pm 0.12$ \\% reachspace reached per octanct (mean $\\pm$ standard deviation). In contrast, the offset camera view underestimated the percent workspace reached ($-5.66 \\pm 0.45$ \\% reachspace reached). Conclusion: The findings support the feasibility of a frontal monocular camera configuration for UERW assessment, particularly for anterior workspace evaluation where agreement with marker-based motion capture was highest. The overall performance demonstrates clinical potential for practical, single-camera assessments. This study provides the first validation of monocular MMC system for the assessment of the UERW task. By reducing technical complexity, this approach enables broader implementation of quantitative upper extremity mobility assessment.",
