## 0. [AREA3D: Active Reconstruction Agent with Unified Feed-Forward 3D Perception and Vision-Language Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05131) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05131
**Authors:** Tianling Xu, Shengzhe Gan, Leslie Gu, Yuelei Li, Fangneng Zhan, Hanspeter Pfister

**Abstract:**  Active 3D reconstruction enables an agent to autonomously select viewpoints to efficiently obtain accurate and complete scene geometry, rather than passively reconstructing scenes from pre-collected images. However, existing active reconstruction methods often rely on hand-crafted geometric heuristics, which can lead to redundant observations without substantially improving reconstruction quality. To address this limitation, we propose AREA3D, an active reconstruction agent that leverages feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and vision-language guidance. Our framework decouples view-uncertainty modeling from the underlying feed-forward reconstructor, enabling precise uncertainty estimation without expensive online optimization. In addition, an integrated vision-language model provides high-level semantic guidance, encouraging informative and diverse viewpoints beyond purely geometric cues. Extensive experiments on both scene-level and object-level benchmarks demonstrate that AREA3D achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy, particularly in the sparse-view regime. Code will be made available at: https://github.com/TianlingXu/AREA3D .

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (spatial intelligence and 3D perception in embodied agents) and criterion 3 (novel method for active 3D reconstruction with vision-language guidance). AREA3D leverages feed-forward 3D models and VLMs for active viewpoint selection, improving reconstruction accuracy.

## 1. [Active Video Perception: Iterative Evidence Seeking for Agentic Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05774) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05774
**Authors:** Ziyang Wang, Honglu Zhou, Shijie Wang, Junnan Li, Caiming Xiong, Silvio Savarese, Mohit Bansal, Michael S. Ryoo, Juan Carlos Niebles

**Abstract:**  Long video understanding (LVU) is challenging because answering real-world queries often depends on sparse, temporally dispersed cues buried in hours of mostly redundant and irrelevant content. While agentic pipelines improve video reasoning capabilities, prevailing frameworks rely on a query-agnostic captioner to perceive video information, which wastes computation on irrelevant content and blurs fine-grained temporal and spatial information. Motivated by active perception theory, we argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, and continuously assess whether the current observation is sufficient to answer the query. We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (methodological improvement to spatial and temporal understanding in embodied agents) and criterion 3 (novel agentic method for long video understanding, treating video as an interactive environment). The AVP framework introduces an active, evidence-seeking process for video understanding, outperforming previous agentic methods.

## 2. [EditThinker: Unlocking Iterative Reasoning for Any Image Editor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05965) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05965
**Authors:** Hongyu Li, Manyuan Zhang, Dian Zheng, Ziyu Guo, Yimeng Jia, Kaituo Feng, Hao Yu, Yexin Liu, Yan Feng, Peng Pei, Xunliang Cai, Linjiang Huang, Hongsheng Li, Si Liu

**Abstract:**  Instruction-based image editing has emerged as a prominent research area, which, benefiting from image generation foundation models, have achieved high aesthetic quality, making instruction-following capability the primary challenge. Existing approaches improve instruction adherence via supervised or reinforcement learning, yet single-turn success rates remain limited due to inherent stochasticity and a lack of deliberation. In this work, we propose a deliberative editing framework to 'think' while they edit, which simulates the human cognitive loop by iteratively executing a Think-while-Edit cycle: Critiquing results and Refining instructions , followed by Repeating the generation until satisfactory. Specifically, we train a single MLLM, EditThinker, to act as the reasoning engine of this framework, which jointly produce the critique score, reasoning process, and refined instructions. We employ reinforcement learning to align the EditThinker's thinking with its editing, thereby generating more targeted instruction improvements. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the instruction-following capability of any image editing model by a large margin. We will release our data construction framework, datasets, and models to benefit the community.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new MLLM for image editing with iterative reasoning) and criterion 4 (applies MLLM to image editing, leveraging foundation models). The paper introduces EditThinker, a new MLLM-based framework for instruction-based image editing with a deliberative, iterative process, and demonstrates significant improvements over prior work.

## 3. [Know-Show: Benchmarking Video-Language Models on Spatio-Temporal Grounded Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05513) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05513
**Authors:** Chinthani Sugandhika, Chen Li, Deepu Rajan, Basura Fernando

**Abstract:**  Large Video-Language Models (Video-LMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal understanding, yet their reasoning remains weakly grounded in space and time. We present Know-Show, a new benchmark designed to evaluate spatio-temporal grounded reasoning, the ability of a model to reason about actions and their semantics while simultaneously grounding its inferences in visual and temporal evidence. Know-Show unifies reasoning and localization within a single evaluation framework consisting of five complementary scenarios across spatial (person, object, person-object, and hand-object) and temporal dimensions. Built from Charades, Action Genome, and Ego4D with 2.5K human-authored questions, the benchmark exposes significant gaps between current Video-LMs and human reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose GRAM, a training-free plug-in that augments Video-LMs with fine-grained grounding through attention-based video token selection and explicit timestamp encoding. Extensive experiments across open and closed Video-LMs (Qwen, VideoLLaVA, GPT-4o, and Gemini, etc.) reveal that existing models struggle to "show what they know" and vice versa, especially in fine-grained hand-object interactions. Know-Show establishes a unified standard for assessing grounded reasoning in video-language understanding and provides insights toward developing interpretable and reliable multimodal reasoning systems. We will release the code at https://github.com/LUNAProject22/Know-Show.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 and 3: Introduces Know-Show, a new benchmark for spatio-temporal grounded reasoning in video-language models (VLLMs), and proposes a novel training-free plug-in (GRAM) for fine-grained grounding. Focuses on spatial intelligence and benchmarking for embodied AI.

## 4. [VOST-SGG: VLM-Aided One-Stage Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05524) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05524
**Authors:** Chinthani Sugandhika, Chen Li, Deepu Rajan, Basura Fernando

**Abstract:**  Spatio-temporal scene graph generation (ST-SGG) aims to model objects and their evolving relationships across video frames, enabling interpretable representations for downstream reasoning tasks such as video captioning and visual question answering. Despite recent advancements in DETR-style single-stage ST-SGG models, they still suffer from several key limitations. First, while these models rely on attention-based learnable queries as a core component, these learnable queries are semantically uninformed and instance-agnostically initialized. Second, these models rely exclusively on unimodal visual features for predicate classification. To address these challenges, we propose VOST-SGG, a VLM-aided one-stage ST-SGG framework that integrates the common sense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) into the ST-SGG pipeline. First, we introduce the dual-source query initialization strategy that disentangles what to attend to from where to attend, enabling semantically grounded what-where reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal feature bank that fuses visual, textual, and spatial cues derived from VLMs for improved predicate classification. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VLM-aided semantic priors and multi-modal features for ST-SGG. We will release the code at https://github.com/LUNAProject22/VOST.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 1 (spatial understanding on embodied agents) and 2 (new VLLMs/MLLMs). The paper proposes a VLM-aided spatio-temporal scene graph generation method, integrating vision-language models for improved spatial and semantic reasoning in video. Also relevant to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications).

## 5. [SpaceControl: Introducing Test-Time Spatial Control to 3D Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05343) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05343
**Authors:** Elisabetta Fedele, Francis Engelmann, Ian Huang, Or Litany, Marc Pollefeys, Leonidas Guibas

**Abstract:**  Generative methods for 3D assets have recently achieved remarkable progress, yet providing intuitive and precise control over the object geometry remains a key challenge. Existing approaches predominantly rely on text or image prompts, which often fall short in geometric specificity: language can be ambiguous, and images are cumbersome to edit. In this work, we introduce SpaceControl, a training-free test-time method for explicit spatial control of 3D generation. Our approach accepts a wide range of geometric inputs, from coarse primitives to detailed meshes, and integrates seamlessly with modern pre-trained generative models without requiring any additional training. A controllable parameter lets users trade off between geometric fidelity and output realism. Extensive quantitative evaluation and user studies demonstrate that SpaceControl outperforms both training-based and optimization-based baselines in geometric faithfulness while preserving high visual quality. Finally, we present an interactive user interface that enables online editing of superquadrics for direct conversion into textured 3D assets, facilitating practical deployment in creative workflows. Find our project page at https://spacecontrol3d.github.io/

**Comment:** SpaceControl introduces a training-free, test-time method for explicit spatial control in 3D generative modeling, allowing geometric inputs to guide 3D generation. This matches criterion 1 (spatial understanding/methodological improvements) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications), and is highly relevant to generative modeling in multi-modal learning.

## 6. [Semore: VLM-guided Enhanced Semantic Motion Representations for Visual Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05172) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05172
**Authors:** Wentao Wang, Chunyang Liu, Kehua Sheng, Bo Zhang, Yan Wang

**Abstract:**  The growing exploration of Large Language Models (LLM) and Vision-Language Models (VLM) has opened avenues for enhancing the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing LLM-based RL methods often focus on the guidance of control policy and encounter the challenge of limited representations of the backbone networks. To tackle this problem, we introduce Enhanced Semantic Motion Representations (Semore), a new VLM-based framework for visual RL, which can simultaneously extract semantic and motion representations through a dual-path backbone from the RGB flows. Semore utilizes VLM with common-sense knowledge to retrieve key information from observations, while using the pre-trained clip to achieve the text-image alignment, thereby embedding the ground-truth representations into the backbone. To efficiently fuse semantic and motion representations for decision-making, our method adopts a separately supervised approach to simultaneously guide the extraction of semantics and motion, while allowing them to interact spontaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under the guidance of VLM at the feature level, our method exhibits efficient and adaptive ability compared to state-of-art methods. All codes are released.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 and 2: proposes a new VLM-based framework (Semore) for visual RL, enhancing semantic and motion representations for embodied agents using VLMs and CLIP.

## 7. [ChromouVQA: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models under Chromatic Camouflaged Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05137) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05137
**Authors:** Yunfei Zhang, Yizhuo He, Yuanxun Shao, Zhengtao Yao, Haoyan Xu, Junhao Dong, Zhen Yao, Zhikang Dong

**Abstract:**  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced multimodal understanding, yet still struggle when targets are embedded in cluttered backgrounds requiring figure-ground segregation. To address this, we introduce ChromouVQA, a large-scale, multi-task benchmark based on Ishihara-style chromatic camouflaged images. We extend classic dot plates with multiple fill geometries and vary chromatic separation, density, size, occlusion, and rotation, recording full metadata for reproducibility. The benchmark covers nine vision-question-answering tasks, including recognition, counting, comparison, and spatial reasoning. Evaluations of humans and VLMs reveal large gaps, especially under subtle chromatic contrast or disruptive geometric fills. We also propose a model-agnostic contrastive recipe aligning silhouettes with their camouflaged renderings, improving recovery of global shapes. ChromouVQA provides a compact, controlled benchmark for reproducible evaluation and extension. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Chromou-VQA-Benchmark/Chromou-VQA.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 and 4: introduces a new benchmark (ChromouVQA) for VLMs on chromatic camouflaged images, focusing on spatial reasoning and figure-ground segregation, and provides a model-agnostic contrastive recipe for VLMs.

## 8. [PRiSM: An Agentic Multimodal Benchmark for Scientific Reasoning via Python-Grounded Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05930) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05930
**Authors:** Shima Imani, Seungwhan Moon, Adel Ahmadyan, Lu Zhang, Kirmani Ahmed, Babak Damavandi

**Abstract:**  Evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in scientific domains like mathematics and physics poses unique challenges that go far beyond predicting final answers. These domains demand conceptual understanding, symbolic reasoning, and adherence to formal laws, requirements that most existing benchmarks fail to address. In particular, current datasets tend to be static, lacking intermediate reasoning steps, robustness to variations, or mechanisms for verifying scientific correctness. To address these limitations, we introduce PRiSM, a synthetic, fully dynamic, and multimodal benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning via grounded Python code. PRiSM includes over 24,750 university-level physics and math problems, and it leverages our scalable agent-based pipeline, PrismAgent, to generate well-structured problem instances. Each problem contains dynamic textual and visual input, a generated figure, alongside rich structured outputs: executable Python code for ground truth generation and verification, and detailed step-by-step reasoning. The dynamic nature and Python-powered automated ground truth generation of our benchmark allow for fine-grained experimental auditing of multimodal VLMs, revealing failure modes, uncertainty behaviors, and limitations in scientific reasoning. To this end, we propose five targeted evaluation tasks covering generalization, symbolic program synthesis, perturbation robustness, reasoning correction, and ambiguity resolution. Through comprehensive evaluation of existing VLMs, we highlight their limitations and showcase how PRiSM enables deeper insights into their scientific reasoning capabilities.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (new benchmark for embodied AI and VLMs) and criterion 4 (application to vision foundation models). PRiSM is a new, dynamic, multimodal benchmark for scientific reasoning with agent-based pipeline and Python-grounded evaluation, revealing new failure modes in VLMs.

## 9. [ShaRP: SHAllow-LayeR Pruning for Video Large Language Models Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05385) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05385
**Authors:** Yingjie Xia, Tao Liu, Jinglei Shi, Qingsong Xie, Heng Guo, Jian Yang, Xi Wang

**Abstract:**  Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) face the challenge of high computational load during the pre-filling stage due to the processing of an enormous number of visual tokens. Although attention-based pruning methods are widely used to accelerate inference, trials at early decoder layers often result in significant performance degradation, especially under high compression rates. We argue that while attention-based pruning inherently holds the potential to identify the most relevant visual tokens, its effectiveness in shallow decoder layers is limited by factors such as positional encoding bias and insufficient information interaction. In this paper, we propose an improved attention-based pruning framework, termed ShaRP, that integrates segment-aware causal masking, positional debiasing, and token deduplication for enhanced token selection. It enables effective pruning at shallow layers while maintaining stable performance under high compression rates without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShaRP achieves competitive performance across multiple video understanding benchmarks, establishing a new paradigm for accelerating VLLM inference.

**Comment:** ShaRP is a framework for accelerating Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) via shallow-layer pruning with novel attention-based techniques. This directly matches criterion 2 (new VLLMs) and is relevant to efficient inference in multi-modal models.

## 10. [SCAIL: Towards Studio-Grade Character Animation via In-Context Learning of 3D-Consistent Pose Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05905) <a id="link10"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05905
**Authors:** Wenhao Yan, Sheng Ye, Zhuoyi Yang, Jiayan Teng, ZhenHui Dong, Kairui Wen, Xiaotao Gu, Yong-Jin Liu, Jie Tang

**Abstract:**  Achieving character animation that meets studio-grade production standards remains challenging despite recent progress. Existing approaches can transfer motion from a driving video to a reference image, but often fail to preserve structural fidelity and temporal consistency in wild scenarios involving complex motion and cross-identity animations. In this work, we present \textbf{SCAIL} (\textbf{S}tudio-grade \textbf{C}haracter \textbf{A}nimation via \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{L}earning), a framework designed to address these challenges from two key innovations. First, we propose a novel 3D pose representation, providing a more robust and flexible motion signal. Second, we introduce a full-context pose injection mechanism within a diffusion-transformer architecture, enabling effective spatio-temporal reasoning over full motion sequences. To align with studio-level requirements, we develop a curated data pipeline ensuring both diversity and quality, and establish a comprehensive benchmark for systematic evaluation. Experiments show that \textbf{SCAIL} achieves state-of-the-art performance and advances character animation toward studio-grade reliability and realism.

**Comment:** This paper presents SCAIL, a new framework for studio-grade character animation using a novel 3D pose representation and a diffusion-transformer architecture for spatio-temporal reasoning. It also introduces a new benchmark for evaluation. This matches criterion 3 (embodied AI, new benchmark/methods, novel angles) and is relevant to spatial understanding (criterion 1).

## 11. [World Models That Know When They Don't Know: Controllable Video Generation with Calibrated Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05927) <a id="link11"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05927
**Authors:** Zhiting Mei, Tenny Yin, Micah Baker, Ola Shorinwa, Anirudha Majumdar

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in generative video models have led to significant breakthroughs in high-fidelity video synthesis, specifically in controllable video generation where the generated video is conditioned on text and action inputs, e.g., in instruction-guided video editing and world modeling in robotics. Despite these exceptional capabilities, controllable video models often hallucinate - generating future video frames that are misaligned with physical reality - which raises serious concerns in many tasks such as robot policy evaluation and planning. However, state-of-the-art video models lack the ability to assess and express their confidence, impeding hallucination mitigation. To rigorously address this challenge, we propose C3, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for training continuous-scale calibrated controllable video models for dense confidence estimation at the subpatch level, precisely localizing the uncertainty in each generated video frame. Our UQ method introduces three core innovations to empower video models to estimate their uncertainty. First, our method develops a novel framework that trains video models for correctness and calibration via strictly proper scoring rules. Second, we estimate the video model's uncertainty in latent space, avoiding training instability and prohibitive training costs associated with pixel-space approaches. Third, we map the dense latent-space uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level uncertainty in the RGB space for intuitive visualization, providing high-resolution uncertainty heatmaps that identify untrustworthy regions. Through extensive experiments on large-scale robot learning datasets (Bridge and DROID) and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that our method not only provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within the training distribution, but also enables effective out-of-distribution detection.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4: introduces uncertainty quantification for controllable video generation in world models, with applications in robotics and vision foundation models.

**Abstract:**  Unified multimodal models significantly improve visual generation by combining vision-language models (VLMs) with diffusion models. However, existing methods struggle to fully balance sufficient interaction and flexible implementation due to vast representation difference. Considering abundant and hierarchical information in VLM's layers from low-level details to high-level semantics, we propose \textbf{ParaUni}. It extracts features from variants VLM's layers in a \textbf{Para}llel way for comprehensive information interaction and retains a flexible separation architecture to enhance generation in \textbf{Uni}fied multimodal model. Concretely, visual features from all VLM's layers are fed in parallel into a Layer Integration Module (LIM), which efficiently integrates fine-grained details and semantic abstractions and provides the fused representation as a condition to the diffusion model. To further enhance performance, we reveal that these hierarchical layers respond unequally to different rewards in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Crucially, we design a Layer-wise Dynamic Adjustment Mechanism (LDAM) to facilitate multiple reward improvements that aligns the hierarchical properties of these layers using RL. Extensive experiments show ParaUni leverages complementary multi-layer features to substantially improve generation quality and shows strong potential for multiple reward advances during RL stages. Code is available at https://github.com/JosephTiTan/ParaUni.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (unified multimodal model with VLMs and diffusion models) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and their application to generation). ParaUni introduces a hierarchical, reinforcement-driven information interaction for improved multimodal generation.

## 13. [Inferring Compositional 4D Scenes without Ever Seeing One](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05272) <a id="link13"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05272
**Authors:** Ahmet Berke Gokmen, Ajad Chhatkuli, Luc Van Gool, Danda Pani Paudel

**Abstract:**  Scenes in the real world are often composed of several static and dynamic objects. Capturing their 4-dimensional structures, composition and spatio-temporal configuration in-the-wild, though extremely interesting, is equally hard. Therefore, existing works often focus on one object at a time, while relying on some category-specific parametric shape model for dynamic objects. This can lead to inconsistent scene configurations, in addition to being limited to the modeled object categories. We propose COM4D (Compositional 4D), a method that consistently and jointly predicts the structure and spatio-temporal configuration of 4D/3D objects using only static multi-object or dynamic single object supervision. We achieve this by a carefully designed training of spatial and temporal attentions on 2D video input. The training is disentangled into learning from object compositions on the one hand, and single object dynamics throughout the video on the other, thus completely avoiding reliance on 4D compositional training data. At inference time, our proposed attention mixing mechanism combines these independently learned attentions, without requiring any 4D composition examples. By alternating between spatial and temporal reasoning, COM4D reconstructs complete and persistent 4D scenes with multiple interacting objects directly from monocular videos. Furthermore, COM4D provides state-of-the-art results in existing separate problems of 4D object and composed 3D reconstruction despite being purely data-driven.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1: Proposes COM4D, a method for compositional 4D scene understanding from monocular videos, focusing on spatial and temporal reasoning without 4D compositional training data. Strong spatial intelligence and compositionality angle.

## 14. [VRSA: Jailbreaking Multimodal Large Language Models through Visual Reasoning Sequential Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05853) <a id="link14"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05853
**Authors:** Shiji Zhao, Shukun Xiong, Yao Huang, Yan Jin, Zhenyu Wu, Jiyang Guan, Ranjie Duan, Jialing Tao, Hui Xue, Xingxing Wei

**Abstract:**  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are widely used in various fields due to their powerful cross-modal comprehension and generation capabilities. However, more modalities bring more vulnerabilities to being utilized for jailbreak attacks, which induces MLLMs to output harmful content. Due to the strong reasoning ability of MLLMs, previous jailbreak attacks try to explore reasoning safety risk in text modal, while similar threats have been largely overlooked in the visual modal. To fully evaluate potential safety risks in the visual reasoning task, we propose Visual Reasoning Sequential Attack (VRSA), which induces MLLMs to gradually externalize and aggregate complete harmful intent by decomposing the original harmful text into several sequentially related sub-images. In particular, to enhance the rationality of the scene in the image sequence, we propose Adaptive Scene Refinement to optimize the scene most relevant to the original harmful query. To ensure the semantic continuity of the generated image, we propose Semantic Coherent Completion to iteratively rewrite each sub-text combined with contextual information in this scene. In addition, we propose Text-Image Consistency Alignment to keep the semantical consistency. A series of experiments demonstrates that the VRSA can achieve a higher attack success rate compared with the state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods on both the open-source and closed-source MLLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude-4.5-Sonnet.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (new MLLMs) and is relevant to criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications). The paper introduces a novel attack method for jailbreaking MLLMs via visual reasoning, which is a new angle on model robustness and safety.

## 15. [LoC-Path: Learning to Compress for Pathology Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05391) <a id="link15"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05391
**Authors:** Qingqiao Hu, Weimin Lyu, Meilong Xu, Kehan Qi, Xiaoling Hu, Saumya Gupta, Jiawei Zhou, Chao Chen

**Abstract:**  Whole Slide Image (WSI) understanding is fundamentally challenging due to its gigapixel scale and the extreme sparsity of diagnostically relevant regions. Unlike human experts who primarily rely on key areas to arrive at a diagnosis, existing slide-level multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for pathology rely on heavy slide-level encoders that process thousands of patch features in a brute-force manner, resulting in excessive computational cost. In this work, we revisit the WSI-language modeling paradigm and show that tile-level features exhibit strong global and local redundancy, whereas only a small subset of tiles are truly task-relevant. Motivated by this observation, we introduce an efficient MLLM framework, called LoC-Path, that replaces the expensive slide-level encoder with redundancy-reducing modules. We first design a Sparse Token Merger (STM) and an MAE-pretrained resampler to remove local redundancy and compress globally redundant tile tokens into a compact slide-level representation set. We then propose a Cross-Attention Routing Adapter (CARA) and a Token Importance Scorer (TIS) to integrate the compressed visual representation with the language model in a computation-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to existing state-of-the-art whole-slide MLLMs, while requiring significantly lower computation and memory.

**Comment:** This paper introduces LoC-Path, an efficient multimodal large language model (MLLM) for pathology whole slide image understanding, with novel redundancy-reducing modules. This matches criterion 2 (new MLLMs) and is also relevant to vision foundation models (criterion 4).

## 16. [Self-Improving VLM Judges Without Human Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05145) <a id="link16"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05145
**Authors:** Inna Wanyin Lin, Yushi Hu, Shuyue Stella Li, Scott Geng, Pang Wei Koh, Luke Zettlemoyer, Tim Althoff, Marjan Ghazvininejad

**Abstract:**  Effective judges of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are crucial for model development. Current methods for training VLM judges mainly rely on large-scale human preference annotations. However, such an approach is costly, and the annotations easily become obsolete as models rapidly improve. In this work, we present a framework to self-train a VLM judge model without any human preference annotations, using only self-synthesized data. Our method is iterative and has three stages: (1) generate diverse multimodal instruction-response pairs at varying quality levels, (2) generate reasoning traces and judgments for each pair, removing the ones that do not match our expected quality levels, and (3) training on correct judge answers and their reasoning traces. We evaluate the resulting judge on Multimodal RewardBench and VL-RewardBench across domains: correctness, preference, reasoning, safety, and visual question-answering. Our method improves a Llama-3.2-11B multimodal judge from 0.38 to 0.51 in overall accuracy on VL-RewardBench, often outperforming much larger models including Llama-3.2-90B, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with particularly strong gains in general, hallucination, and reasoning dimensions. The overall strength of these human-annotation-free results suggest the potential for a future self-judge that evolves alongside rapidly improving VLM capabilities.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2: proposes a self-improving VLM judge without human annotations, improving VLM evaluation and reward modeling.

## 17. [OWL: Unsupervised 3D Object Detection by Occupancy Guided Warm-up and Large Model Priors Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05698) <a id="link17"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05698
**Authors:** Xusheng Guo, Wanfa Zhang, Shijia Zhao, Qiming Xia, Xiaolong Xie, Mingming Wang, Hai Wu, Chenglu Wen

**Abstract:**  Unsupervised 3D object detection leverages heuristic algorithms to discover potential objects, offering a promising route to reduce annotation costs in autonomous driving. Existing approaches mainly generate pseudo labels and refine them through self-training iterations. However, these pseudo-labels are often incorrect at the beginning of training, resulting in misleading the optimization process. Moreover, effectively filtering and refining them remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose OWL for unsupervised 3D object detection by occupancy guided warm-up and large-model priors reasoning. OWL first employs an Occupancy Guided Warm-up (OGW) strategy to initialize the backbone weight with spatial perception capabilities, mitigating the interference of incorrect pseudo-labels on network convergence. Furthermore, OWL introduces an Instance-Cued Reasoning (ICR) module that leverages the prior knowledge of large models to assess pseudo-label quality, enabling precise filtering and refinement. Finally, we design a Weight-adapted Self-training (WAS) strategy to dynamically re-weight pseudo-labels, improving the performance through self-training. Extensive experiments on Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) and KITTI demonstrate that OWL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by over 15.0% mAP, revealing the effectiveness of our method.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (spatial understanding in embodied agents) and criterion 4 (uses large model priors for unsupervised 3D object detection). Proposes OWL, which leverages occupancy-guided warm-up and large model priors for improved unsupervised 3D object detection.

## 18. [Zoom in, Click out: Unlocking and Evaluating the Potential of Zooming for GUI Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05941) <a id="link18"></a>

**Authors:** Zhiyuan Jiang, Shenghao Xie, Wenyi Li, Wenqiang Zu, Peihang Li, Jiahao Qiu, Siqi Pei, Lei Ma, Tiejun Huang, Mengdi Wang, Shilong Liu

**Abstract:**  Grounding is a fundamental capability for building graphical user interface (GUI) agents. Although existing approaches rely on large-scale bounding box supervision, they still face various challenges, such as cross-platform generalization, complex layout analysis, and fine-grained element localization. In this paper, we investigate zoom as a strong yet underexplored prior for GUI grounding, and propose a training-free method, ZoomClick. By characterizing four key properties of zoom (i.e., pre-zoom, depth, shrink size, minimal crop size), we unlock its full capabilities for dynamic spatial focusing and adaptive context switching. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the performance of both general vision-language and specialized GUI grounding models, achieving state-of-the-art results on several mainstream benchmarks; for example, UI-Venus-72B attains a 73.1% success rate on ScreenSpot-Pro. Furthermore, we present GUIZoom-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating model adaptability to zoom, aiming to inspire future research on improving zoom for further training and test-time scaling in GUI grounding tasks.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1: Proposes a novel, training-free method (ZoomClick) for GUI grounding using zoom as a spatial prior, and introduces GUIZoom-Bench, a new benchmark for evaluating adaptability to zoom. Focuses on spatial understanding and intelligence in agents.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05943
**Authors:** Shima Imani, Seungwhan Moon, Lambert Mathias, Lu Zhang, Babak Damavandi

**Abstract:**  Reliable mathematical and scientific reasoning remains an open challenge for large vision-language models. Standard final-answer evaluation often masks reasoning errors, allowing silent failures to persist. To address this gap, we introduce TRACE, a framework for Transparent Reasoning And Consistency Evaluation that diagnoses reasoning trajectories rather than only end results. At its core, TRACE leverages Auxiliary Reasoning Sets, compact sub question answer pairs that decompose complex problems, evaluate intermediate steps through consistency-based metrics, and expose failures overlooked by standard evaluation. Our experiments show that consistency across ARS correlates with final-answer correctness and helps pinpoint the reasoning steps where failures arise, offering actionable signals for model improvement. Furthermore, TRACE defines confidence regions that distinguish reliable from unreliable reasoning paths, supporting effective filtering, debugging, and model refinement.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2: Proposes TRACE, a new framework for analyzing and enhancing stepwise reasoning in vision-language models (VLLMs), with a focus on transparent reasoning and consistency evaluation. Offers actionable signals for model improvement and debugging.

## 20. [See in Depth: Training-Free Surgical Scene Segmentation with Monocular Depth Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05529) <a id="link20"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05529
**Authors:** Kunyi Yang, Qingyu Wang, Cheng Yuan, Yutong Ban

**Abstract:**  Pixel-wise segmentation of laparoscopic scenes is essential for computer-assisted surgery but difficult to scale due to the high cost of dense annotations. We propose depth-guided surgical scene segmentation (DepSeg), a training-free framework that utilizes monocular depth as a geometric prior together with pretrained vision foundation models. DepSeg first estimates a relative depth map with a pretrained monocular depth estimation network and proposes depth-guided point prompts, which SAM2 converts into class-agnostic masks. Each mask is then described by a pooled pretrained visual feature and classified via template matching against a template bank built from annotated frames. On the CholecSeg8k dataset, DepSeg improves over a direct SAM2 auto segmentation baseline (35.9% vs. 14.7% mIoU) and maintains competitive performance even when using only 10--20% of the object templates. These results show that depth-guided prompting and template-based classification offer an annotation-efficient segmentation approach.

**Comment:** This paper proposes a training-free, depth-guided surgical scene segmentation framework using monocular depth priors and pretrained vision foundation models. This matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) and is also relevant to spatial understanding (criterion 1).

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05354
**Authors:** Yang Zheng, Hao Tan, Kai Zhang, Peng Wang, Leonidas Guibas, Gordon Wetzstein, Wang Yifan

**Abstract:**  The rise of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized photorealistic 3D asset creation, yet a critical gap remains for their interactive refinement and editing. Existing approaches based on diffusion or optimization are ill-suited for this task, as they are often prohibitively slow, destructive to the original asset's identity, or lack the precision for fine-grained control. To address this, we introduce \ourmethod, a state-aware feedforward model that enables continuous editing of 3D Gaussian assets from user-provided 2D view(s). Our method directly predicts updates to the attributes of a compact, feature-rich Gaussian representation and leverages Test-Time Training to create a state-aware, iterative workflow. The versatility of our approach allows a single architecture to perform diverse tasks, including high-fidelity local detail refinement, local paint-over, and consistent global recoloring, all at interactive speeds, paving the way for fluid and intuitive 3D content authoring.

**Comment:** SplatPainter enables interactive authoring of 3D Gaussians from 2D edits via test-time training, allowing for intuitive 3D content authoring. This is relevant to spatial understanding and generative modeling in vision, matching criterion 1 (spatial intelligence/methodological improvements) and criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications).

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05240
**Authors:** Dmitrii Torbunov, Onur Okuducu, Yi Huang, Odera Dim, Rebecca Coles, Yonggang Cui, Yihui Ren

**Abstract:**  Continuous video monitoring in surveillance, robotics, and wearable systems faces a fundamental power constraint: conventional RGB cameras consume substantial energy through fixed-rate capture. Event cameras offer sparse, motion-driven sensing with low power consumption, but produce asynchronous event streams rather than RGB video. We propose a hybrid capture paradigm that records sparse RGB keyframes alongside continuous event streams, then reconstructs full RGB video offline -- reducing capture power consumption while maintaining standard video output for downstream applications. We introduce the Image and Event to Video (IE2Video) task: reconstructing RGB video sequences from a single initial frame and subsequent event camera data. We investigate two architectural strategies: adapting an autoregressive model (HyperE2VID) for RGB generation, and injecting event representations into a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model (LTX) via learned encoders and low-rank adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that the diffusion-based approach achieves 33\% better perceptual quality than the autoregressive baseline (0.283 vs 0.422 LPIPS). We validate our approach across three event camera datasets (BS-ERGB, HS-ERGB far/close) at varying sequence lengths (32-128 frames), demonstrating robust cross-dataset generalization with strong performance on unseen capture configurations.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4: adapts pretrained diffusion models for event-based video reconstruction, bridging event cameras and RGB video using vision foundation models.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05557
**Authors:** Xingxi Yin, Yicheng Li, Gong Yan, Chenglin Li, Jian Zhao, Cong Huang, Yue Deng, Yin Zhang

**Abstract:**  Sequential identity consistency under precise transient attribute control remains a long-standing challenge in controllable visual storytelling. Existing datasets lack sufficient fidelity and fail to disentangle stable identities from transient attributes, limiting structured control over pose, expression, and scene composition and thus constraining reliable sequential synthesis. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{2K-Characters-10K-Stories}, a multi-modal stylized narrative dataset of \textbf{2{,}000} uniquely stylized characters appearing across \textbf{10{,}000} illustration stories. It is the first dataset that pairs large-scale unique identities with explicit, decoupled control signals for sequential identity consistency. We introduce a \textbf{Human-in-the-Loop pipeline (HiL)} that leverages expert-verified character templates and LLM-guided narrative planning to generate highly-aligned structured data. A \textbf{decoupled control} scheme separates persistent identity from transient attributes -- pose and expression -- while a \textbf{Quality-Gated loop} integrating MMLM evaluation, Auto-Prompt Tuning, and Local Image Editing enforces pixel-level consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset achieves performance comparable to closed-source models in generating visual narratives.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 (vision foundation models and applications) and is relevant to multi-modal generative modeling. Introduces a new large-scale, quality-gated dataset for stylized visual storytelling with disentangled control, and a human-in-the-loop pipeline leveraging MMLM evaluation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05663
**Authors:** Johannes Meier, Jonathan Michel, Oussema Dhaouadi, Yung-Hsu Yang, Christoph Reich, Zuria Bauer, Stefan Roth, Marc Pollefeys, Jacques Kaiser, Daniel Cremers

**Abstract:**  Real-time monocular 3D object detection remains challenging due to severe depth ambiguity, viewpoint shifts, and the high computational cost of 3D reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on LiDAR or geometric priors to compensate for missing depth, or sacrifice efficiency to achieve competitive accuracy. We introduce LeAD-M3D, a monocular 3D detector that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time inference without extra modalities. Our method is powered by three key components. Asymmetric Augmentation Denoising Distillation (A2D2) transfers geometric knowledge from a clean-image teacher to a mixup-noised student via a quality- and importance-weighted depth-feature loss, enabling stronger depth reasoning without LiDAR supervision. 3D-aware Consistent Matching (CM3D) improves prediction-to-ground truth assignment by integrating 3D MGIoU into the matching score, yielding more stable and precise supervision. Finally, Confidence-Gated 3D Inference (CGI3D) accelerates detection by restricting expensive 3D regression to top-confidence regions. Together, these components set a new Pareto frontier for monocular 3D detection: LeAD-M3D achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on KITTI and Waymo, and the best reported car AP on Rope3D, while running up to 3.6x faster than prior high-accuracy methods. Our results demonstrate that high fidelity and real-time efficiency in monocular 3D detection are simultaneously attainable - without LiDAR, stereo, or geometric assumptions.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (methodological improvements to spatial intelligence) and is relevant to embodied AI and vision foundation models (criteria 3 and 4). The paper introduces new methods for monocular 3D detection, including clever distillation and matching techniques for spatial reasoning.

**Abstract:**  Low-grade gliomas frequently present IDH1 mutations that define clinically distinct subgroups with specific prognostic and therapeutic implications. This work introduces a Multimodal Oncology Agent (MOA) integrating a histology tool based on the TITAN foundation model for IDH1 mutation prediction in low-grade glioma, combined with reasoning over structured clinical and genomic inputs through PubMed, Google Search, and OncoKB. MOA reports were quantitatively evaluated on 488 patients from the TCGA-LGG cohort against clinical and histology baselines. MOA without the histology tool outperformed the clinical baseline, achieving an F1-score of 0.826 compared to 0.798. When fused with histology features, MOA reached the highest performance with an F1-score of 0.912, exceeding both the histology baseline at 0.894 and the fused histology-clinical baseline at 0.897. These results demonstrate that the proposed agent captures complementary mutation-relevant information enriched through external biomedical sources, enabling accurate IDH1 mutation prediction.

**Comment:** This paper introduces a Multimodal Oncology Agent (MOA) that integrates a histology tool based on the TITAN foundation model for mutation prediction, combining vision foundation models with structured data and external biomedical sources.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05134
**Authors:** Zihao Wu

**Abstract:**  Diffusion models deliver high-fidelity synthesis but remain slow due to iterative sampling. We empirically observe there exists feature invariance in deterministic sampling, and present InvarDiff, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the relative temporal invariance across timestep-scale and layer-scale. From a few deterministic runs, we compute a per-timestep, per-layer, per-module binary cache plan matrix and use a re-sampling correction to avoid drift when consecutive caches occur. Using quantile-based change metrics, this matrix specifies which module at which step is reused rather than recomputed. The same invariance criterion is applied at the step scale to enable cross-timestep caching, deciding whether an entire step can reuse cached results. During inference, InvarDiff performs step-first and layer-wise caching guided by this matrix. When applied to DiT and FLUX, our approach reduces redundant compute while preserving fidelity. Experiments show that InvarDiff achieves $2$-$3\times$ end-to-end speed-ups with minimal impact on standard quality metrics. Qualitatively, we observe almost no degradation in visual quality compared with full computations.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4: proposes InvarDiff, a training-free acceleration method for diffusion models, improving efficiency of vision foundation models.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05139
**Authors:** Yang Xiang, Jingwen Zhong, Yige Yan, Petros Koutrakis, Eric Garshick, Meredith Franklin

**Abstract:**  We present a transfer-learning generative downscaling framework to reconstruct fine resolution satellite images from coarse scale inputs. Our approach combines a lightweight U-Net transfer encoder with a diffusion-based generative model. The simpler U-Net is first pretrained on a long time series of coarse resolution data to learn spatiotemporal representations; its encoder is then frozen and transferred to a larger downscaling model as physically meaningful latent features. Our application uses NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis as the low resolution source domain (50 km) and the GEOS-5 Nature Run (G5NR) as the high resolution target (7 km). Our study area included a large area in Asia, which was made computationally tractable by splitting into two subregions and four seasons. We conducted domain similarity analysis using Wasserstein distances confirmed minimal distributional shift between MERRA-2 and G5NR, validating the safety of parameter frozen transfer. Across seasonal regional splits, our model achieved excellent performance (R2 = 0.65 to 0.94), outperforming comparison models including deterministic U-Nets, variational autoencoders, and prior transfer learning baselines. Out of data evaluations using semivariograms, ACF/PACF, and lag-based RMSE/R2 demonstrated that the predicted downscaled images preserved physically consistent spatial variability and temporal autocorrelation, enabling stable autoregressive reconstruction beyond the G5NR record. These results show that transfer enhanced diffusion models provide a robust and physically coherent solution for downscaling a long time series of coarse resolution images with limited training periods. This advancement has significant implications for improving environmental exposure assessment and long term environmental monitoring.

**Authors:** Yida Lin, Bing Xue, Mengjie Zhang, Sam Schofield, Richard Green

**Abstract:**  UAV-based autonomous forestry operations require rapid and precise tree branch segmentation for safe navigation and automated pruning across varying pixel resolutions and operational conditions. We evaluate different deep learning methods at three resolutions (256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024) using the Urban Street Tree Dataset, employing standard metrics (IoU, Dice) and specialized measures including Thin Structure IoU (TS-IoU) and Connectivity Preservation Rate (CPR). Among 22 configurations tested, U-Net with MiT-B4 backbone achieves strong performance at 256x256. At 512x512, MiT-B4 leads in IoU, Dice, TS-IoU, and Boundary-F1. At 1024x1024, U-Net+MiT-B3 shows the best validation performance for IoU/Dice and precision, while U-Net++ excels in boundary quality. PSPNet provides the most efficient option (2.36/9.43/37.74 GFLOPs) with 25.7/19.6/11.8 percentage point IoU reductions compared to top performers at respective resolutions. These results establish multi-resolution benchmarks for accuracy-efficiency trade-offs in embedded forestry systems. Implementation is available at https://github.com/BennyLinntu/PerformanceTreeBranchSegmentation.

**Authors:** Shima Imani, Seungwhan Moon, Adel Ahmadyan, Lu Zhang, Kirmani Ahmed, Babak Damavandi

**Abstract:**  We introduce, a large-scale synthetic benchmark of 15,045 university-level physics problems (90/10% train/test split). Each problem is fully parameterized, supporting an effectively infinite range of input configurations, and is accompanied by structured, step-by-step reasoning and executable Python code that produces the ground-truth solution for any parameter set. The benchmark contains three question types: MC-Symbolic (multiple-choice with symbolic options), MC-Numerical (multiple-choice with numerical options), and free-form (open-ended responses). These diverse formats test complementary reasoning skills. By leveraging the dynamic, code-driven nature of the benchmark, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics in addition to standard accuracy: Consistency Score, Failure Rate, and Confusion Rate, that quantify variability and uncertainty across problem variants. Experiments with state-of-the-art instruction-tuned language models reveal both strengths and limitations in scientific reasoning, positioning SymPyBench as a foundation for developing more robust and interpretable reasoning systems

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (new benchmark for scientific reasoning, but not specifically embodied AI or simulator-related). SymPyBench is a dynamic, code-driven benchmark for scientific reasoning, but less focused on vision or embodied AI.

**Abstract:**  Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm in RGB-T tracking, enabling downstream task adaptation by freezing pretrained parameters and fine-tuning only a small set of parameters. This set forms a rank space made up of multiple individual ranks, whose expressiveness directly shapes the model's adaptability. However, quantitative analysis reveals low-rank adaptation exhibits significant redundancy in the rank space, with many ranks contributing almost no practical information. This hinders the model's ability to learn more diverse knowledge to address the various challenges in RGB-T tracking. To address this issue, we propose the Group Orthogonal Low-Rank Adaptation (GOLA) framework for RGB-T tracking, which effectively leverages the rank space through structured parameter learning. Specifically, we adopt a rank decomposition partitioning strategy utilizing singular value decomposition to quantify rank importance, freeze crucial ranks to preserve the pretrained priors, and cluster the redundant ranks into groups to prepare for subsequent orthogonal constraints. We further design an inter-group orthogonal constraint strategy. This constraint enforces orthogonality between rank groups, compelling them to learn complementary features that target diverse challenges, thereby alleviating information redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLA effectively reduces parameter redundancy and enhances feature representation capabilities, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets and validating its effectiveness in RGB-T tracking tasks.

**Comment:** This paper introduces a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for RGB-T tracking, which is a computer vision task. While it is relevant to vision and machine learning, it does not directly address spatial intelligence in embodied agents, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI benchmarks, or vision foundation models.

**Authors:** Zeyuan Ma, Wenqi Huang, Guo-Huan Song, Hongshu Guo, Sijie Ma, Zhiguang Cao, Yue-Jiao Gong

**Abstract:**  Machine intelligence marks the ultimate dream of making machines' intelligence comparable to human beings. While recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) show substantial specific skills for a wide array of downstream tasks, they more or less fall shorts in general intelligence. Following correlation between intelligence and system 2 reasoning (slow thinking), in this paper, we aim to answering a worthwhile research question: could machine intelligence such as LLMs be evolved to acquire reasoning ability (not specific skill) just like our human beings? To this end, we propose evolutionary reasoning optimization (ERO) framework which performs survival of the fittest over a population of LLMs to search for individual with strong reasoning ability. Given a reasoning task, ERO first initializes multiple LLMs as a population, after which an evolutionary strategy evolves the population to maximize quantified reasoning score of the best individual. Based on experiments on representative testsuites, we claim two surprising empirical discoveries: i) the latest LLMs such as GPT-5 still show limited system 2 reasoning ability; ii) with simple evolution-loop of ERO, a relatively weak model (Qwen-7B) could be enhanced to emerge powerful reasoning ability. Our project can be accessed at https://github.com/MetaEvo/ERO for reproduction needs.

**Comment:** Somewhat related to criterion 2: Proposes an evolutionary optimization framework to enhance reasoning in LLMs, but not specifically focused on visual or multi-modal models. Interesting empirical results on reasoning ability.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05936
**Authors:** Anne Sielemann, Lena Loercher, Max-Lion Schumacher, Stefan Wolf, Masoud Roschani, Jens Ziehn

**Abstract:**  In this paper, we present a synthesis pipeline and dataset for training / testing data in the task of traffic sign recognition that combines the advantages of data-driven and analytical modeling: GAN-based texture generation enables data-driven dirt and wear artifacts, rendering unique and realistic traffic sign surfaces, while the analytical scene modulation achieves physically correct lighting and allows detailed parameterization. In particular, the latter opens up applications in the context of explainable AI (XAI) and robustness tests due to the possibility of evaluating the sensitivity to parameter changes, which we demonstrate with experiments. Our resulting synthetic traffic sign recognition dataset Synset Signset Germany contains a total of 105500 images of 211 different German traffic sign classes, including newly published (2020) and thus comparatively rare traffic signs. In addition to a mask and a segmentation image, we also provide extensive metadata including the stochastically selected environment and imaging effect parameters for each image. We evaluate the degree of realism of Synset Signset Germany on the real-world German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) and in comparison to CATERED, a state-of-the-art synthetic traffic sign recognition dataset.

**Comment:** This paper presents a synthetic dataset for German traffic sign recognition using GAN-based texture generation and analytical scene modulation. While it is relevant to computer vision and dataset creation, it does not match the specific criteria of spatial intelligence, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI benchmarks, or vision foundation models.

## 33. [Semantic Faithfulness and Entropy Production Measures to Tame Your LLM Demons and Manage Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05156) <a id="link33"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05156
**Authors:** Igor Halperin

**Abstract:**  Evaluating faithfulness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to a given task is a complex challenge. We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\bf Q}$ and ${\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control. We demonstrate our framework on LLM summarization of corporate SEC 10-K filings.

**Comment:** This paper proposes new unsupervised metrics for evaluating LLM faithfulness using information theory and thermodynamics, but it does not address spatial understanding, VLLMs/MLLMs, embodied AI, or vision foundation models. It is more about LLM evaluation.

## 34. [WaterWave: Bridging Underwater Image Enhancement into Video Streams via Wavelet-based Temporal Consistency Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05492) <a id="link34"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05492
**Authors:** Qi Zhu, Jingyi Zhang, Naishan Zheng, Wei Yu, Jinghao Zhang, Deyi Ji, Feng Zhao

**Abstract:**  Underwater video pairs are fairly difficult to obtain due to the complex underwater imaging. In this case, most existing video underwater enhancement methods are performed by directly applying the single-image enhancement model frame by frame, but a natural issue is lacking temporal consistency. To relieve the problem, we rethink the temporal manifold inherent in natural videos and observe a temporal consistency prior in dynamic scenes from the local temporal frequency perspective. Building upon the specific prior and no paired-data condition, we propose an implicit representation manner for enhanced video signals, which is conducted in the wavelet-based temporal consistency field, WaterWave. Specifically, under the constraints of the prior, we progressively filter and attenuate the inconsistent components while preserving motion details and scenes, achieving a natural-flowing video. Furthermore, to represent temporal frequency bands more accurately, an underwater flow correction module is designed to rectify estimated flows considering the transmission in underwater scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WaterWave significantly enhances the quality of videos generated using single-image underwater enhancements. Additionally, our method demonstrates high potential in downstream underwater tracking tasks, such as UOSTrack and MAT, outperforming the original video by a large margin, i.e., 19.7% and 9.7% on precise respectively.

**Comment:** Somewhat related to criterion 4: proposes a wavelet-based temporal consistency field for underwater video enhancement, with potential applications in vision foundation models, but not a direct match.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05481
**Authors:** Jialin Li, Yiwei Ren, Kai Pan, Dong Wei, Pujin Cheng, Xian Wu, Xiaoying Tang

**Abstract:**  Recently, Multi-Contrast MR Reconstruction (MCMR) has emerged as a hot research topic that leverages high-quality auxiliary modalities to reconstruct undersampled target modalities of interest. However, existing methods often struggle to generalize across different k-space undersampling patterns, requiring the training of a separate model for each specific pattern, which limits their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we propose UniFS, a Unified Frequency-Spatial Fusion model designed to handle multiple k-space undersampling patterns for MCMR tasks without any need for retraining. UniFS integrates three key modules: a Cross-Modal Frequency Fusion module, an Adaptive Mask-Based Prompt Learning module, and a Dual-Branch Complementary Refinement module. These modules work together to extract domain-invariant features from diverse k-space undersampling patterns while dynamically adapt to their own variations. Another limitation of existing MCMR methods is their tendency to focus solely on spatial information while neglect frequency characteristics, or extract only shallow frequency features, thus failing to fully leverage complementary cross-modal frequency information. To relieve this issue, UniFS introduces an adaptive prompt-guided frequency fusion module for k-space learning, significantly enhancing the model's generalization performance. We evaluate our model on the BraTS and HCP datasets with various k-space undersampling patterns and acceleration factors, including previously unseen patterns, to comprehensively assess UniFS's generalizability. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate that UniFS achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/LIKP0/UniFS.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05651
**Authors:** Nan Zhong, Mian Zou, Yiran Xu, Zhenxing Qian, Xinpeng Zhang, Baoyuan Wu, Kede Ma

**Abstract:**  The proliferation of AI-generated imagery poses escalating challenges for multimedia forensics, yet many existing detectors depend on assumptions about the internals of specific generative models, limiting their cross-model applicability. We introduce a self-supervised approach for detecting AI-generated images that leverages camera metadata -- specifically exchangeable image file format (EXIF) tags -- to learn features intrinsic to digital photography. Our pretext task trains a feature extractor solely on camera-captured photographs by classifying categorical EXIF tags (\eg, camera model and scene type) and pairwise-ranking ordinal and continuous EXIF tags (\eg, focal length and aperture value). Using these EXIF-induced features, we first perform one-class detection by modeling the distribution of photographic images with a Gaussian mixture model and flagging low-likelihood samples as AI-generated. We then extend to binary detection that treats the learned extractor as a strong regularizer for a classifier of the same architecture, operating on high-frequency residuals from spatially scrambled patches. Extensive experiments across various generative models demonstrate that our EXIF-induced detectors substantially advance the state of the art, delivering strong generalization to in-the-wild samples and robustness to common benign image perturbations.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05613
**Authors:** Pasquale De Marinis, Pieter M. Blok, Uzay Kaymak, Rogier Brussee, Gennaro Vessio, Giovanna Castellano

**Abstract:**  Cross-Domain Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (CD-FSS) seeks to segment unknown classes in unseen domains using only a few annotated examples. This setting is inherently challenging: source and target domains exhibit substantial distribution shifts, label spaces are disjoint, and support images are scarce--making standard episodic methods unreliable and computationally demanding at test time. To address these constraints, we propose DistillFSS, a framework that embeds support-set knowledge directly into a model's parameters through a teacher--student distillation process. By internalizing few-shot reasoning into a dedicated layer within the student network, DistillFSS eliminates the need for support images at test time, enabling fast, lightweight inference, while allowing efficient extension to novel classes in unseen domains through rapid teacher-driven specialization. Combined with fine-tuning, the approach scales efficiently to large support sets and significantly reduces computational overhead. To evaluate the framework under realistic conditions, we introduce a new CD-FSS benchmark spanning medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing, with disjoint label spaces and variable support sizes. Experiments show that DistillFSS matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in multi-class and multi-shot scenarios, while offering substantial efficiency gains. The code is available at https://github.com/pasqualedem/DistillFSS.

**Abstract:**  One of the greatest challenges for detecting moving objects in the solar system from wide-field survey data is determining whether a signal indicates a true object or is due to some other source, like noise. Object verification has relied heavily on human eyes, which usually results in significant labor costs. In order to address this limitation and reduce the reliance on manual intervention, we propose a multi-input convolutional neural network integrated with a convolutional block attention module. This method is specifically tailored to enhance the moving object detection system that we have developed and used previously. The current method introduces two innovations. This first one is a multi-input architecture that processes multiple stacked images simultaneously. The second is the incorporation of the convolutional block attention module which enables the model to focus on essential features in both spatial and channel dimensions. These advancements facilitate efficient learning from multiple inputs, leading to more robust detection of moving objects. The performance of the model is evaluated on a dataset consisting of approximately 2,000 observational images. We achieved an accuracy of nearly 99% with AUC (an Area Under the Curve) of >0.99. These metrics indicate that the proposed model achieves excellent classification performance. By adjusting the threshold for object detection, the new model reduces the human workload by more than 99% compared to manual verification.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05759
**Authors:** Johannes Meyer, Jasper Hoffmann, Felix Schulz, Dominik Merkle, Daniel Buescher, Alexander Reiterer, Joschka Boedecker, Wolfram Burgard

**Abstract:**  Semantic segmentation of 3D point cloud data often comes with high annotation costs. Active learning automates the process of selecting which data to annotate, reducing the total amount of annotation needed to achieve satisfactory performance. Recent approaches to active learning for 3D point clouds are often based on sophisticated heuristics for both, splitting point clouds into annotatable regions and selecting the most beneficial for further neural network training. In this work, we propose a novel and easy-to-implement strategy to separate the point cloud into annotatable regions. In our approach, we utilize a 2D grid to subdivide the point cloud into columns. To identify the next data to be annotated, we employ a network ensemble to estimate the uncertainty in the network output. We evaluate our method on the S3DIS dataset, the Toronto-3D dataset, and a large-scale urban 3D point cloud of the city of Freiburg, which we labeled in parts manually. The extensive evaluation shows that our method yields performance on par with, or even better than, complex state-of-the-art methods on all datasets. Furthermore, we provide results suggesting that in the context of point clouds the annotated area can be a more meaningful measure for active learning algorithms than the number of annotated points.

## 40. [DashFusion: Dual-stream Alignment with Hierarchical Bottleneck Fusion for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05515) <a id="link40"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05515
**Authors:** Yuhua Wen, Qifei Li, Yingying Zhou, Yingming Gao, Zhengqi Wen, Jianhua Tao, Ya Li

**Abstract:**  Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) integrates various modalities, such as text, image, and audio, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of sentiment. However, effective MSA is challenged by alignment and fusion issues. Alignment requires synchronizing both temporal and semantic information across modalities, while fusion involves integrating these aligned features into a unified representation. Existing methods often address alignment or fusion in isolation, leading to limitations in performance and efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dual-stream Alignment with Hierarchical Bottleneck Fusion (DashFusion). Firstly, dual-stream alignment module synchronizes multimodal features through temporal and semantic alignment. Temporal alignment employs cross-modal attention to establish frame-level correspondences among multimodal sequences. Semantic alignment ensures consistency across the feature space through contrastive learning. Secondly, supervised contrastive learning leverages label information to refine the modality features. Finally, hierarchical bottleneck fusion progressively integrates multimodal information through compressed bottleneck tokens, which achieves a balance between performance and computational efficiency. We evaluate DashFusion on three datasets: CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS. Experimental results demonstrate that DashFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our alignment and fusion techniques. The codes for our experiments are available at https://github.com/ultramarineX/DashFusion.

**ArXiv ID:** 2512.05937
**Authors:** Anne Sielemann, Valentin Barner, Stefan Wolf, Masoud Roschani, Jens Ziehn, Juergen Beyerer

**Abstract:**  Common approaches to explainable AI (XAI) for deep learning focus on analyzing the importance of input features on the classification task in a given model: saliency methods like SHAP and GradCAM are used to measure the impact of spatial regions of the input image on the classification result. Combined with ground truth information about the location of the object in the input image (e.g., a binary mask), it is determined whether object pixels had a high impact on the classification result, or whether the classification focused on background pixels. The former is considered to be a sign of a healthy classifier, whereas the latter is assumed to suggest overfitting on spurious correlations. A major challenge, however, is that these intuitive interpretations are difficult to test quantitatively, and hence the output of such explanations lacks an explanation itself. One particular reason is that correlations in real-world data are difficult to avoid, and whether they are spurious or legitimate is debatable. Synthetic data in turn can facilitate to actively enable or disable correlations where desired but often lack a sufficient quantification of realism and stochastic properties. [...] Therefore, we systematically generate six synthetic datasets for the task of traffic sign recognition, which differ only in their degree of camera variation and background correlation [...] to quantify the isolated influence of background correlation, different levels of camera variation, and considered traffic sign shapes on the classification performance, as well as background feature importance. [...] Results include a quantification of when and how much background features gain importance to support the classification task based on changes in the training domain [...].

**Authors:** Yida Lin, Bing Xue, Mengjie Zhang, Sam Schofield, Richard Green

**Abstract:**  Traditional stereo matching algorithms like Semi-Global Block Matching (SGBM) with Weighted Least Squares (WLS) filtering offer speed advantages over neural networks for UAV applications, generating disparity maps in approximately 0.5 seconds per frame. However, these algorithms require meticulous parameter tuning. We propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based parameter optimization framework that systematically searches for optimal parameter configurations for SGBM and WLS, enabling UAVs to measure distances to tree branches with enhanced precision while maintaining processing efficiency. Our contributions include: (1) a novel GA-based parameter optimization framework that eliminates manual tuning; (2) a comprehensive evaluation methodology using multiple image quality metrics; and (3) a practical solution for resource-constrained UAV systems. Experimental results demonstrate that our GA-optimized approach reduces Mean Squared Error by 42.86% while increasing Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Structural Similarity by 8.47% and 28.52%, respectively, compared with baseline configurations. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates superior generalization performance across varied imaging conditions, which is critcal for real-world forestry applications.
